## My Current EMACS config
Based on the April, 2020 config, but started over from scratch.
Was having trouble getting org-roam installed (without starting with a basic Doom installation, which I didn't want), so dropped back to an empty init.el, and brought things up one by one.
By now org-roam is basically working, but more importantly, everything else works as expected (I had some work to do).
Will try to keep this updated better than last time.
