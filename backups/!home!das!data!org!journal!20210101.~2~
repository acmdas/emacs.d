** 14:02 Happy New Year! I neglected to start a 20210101 backup of the data drive, so I didn't begin this until it had finished (and I did a GNUCash backup and started the media backup). I slept well, 0033-0857, 7:49 90. Michael S. called - second day in a row. Valerie suggested that we replace the mattress, and I wholeheartedly agree. We'll begin some research to make our choice. Miriam's whole family came by around 1300 with a Birthday card (handmade) and a Happy New Years card, plus an oragami phoenix. Joey isn't doing well and may be put down soon. I got into my second cupa too soon and became quite dizzy and eyes unfocused around noon. Just tapering off now. Guess I'll have to get used to the half-caf stuff from Wegmans. It's really not that bad.
** 17:21 By now the media backup is a little over half done. A pretty quiet day. I'll be fixing Mission BBQ's recipe for black-eyed peas. Apparently eating them on New Years Day brings good luck. We renewed our Lacquie Lawson account and sent cards to family and friends.
** 19:39 Got almost to the end of the media backup and noticed that I had removed the "exclude media/backup" instruction, so I've restarted the whole media backup. It will finish sometime around 0200-0300 tomorrow. No biggie. I'll get that straightened out by next month, I'm sure - just have to get everything used to being 2021. Made the black-eyed peas - they were good but if I do it again I'll leave the cayenne out entirely. Did the dishes, it's raining to beat the band right now. Predicted 54 and sunny tomorrow, then another day of rain on Sunday, high 41.
** 22:27 Had my cereal - play a game and go to bed. When the Media backup finishes, tomorrow, I'll move the camera files from data to media. They're almost completely stable and have been for some time.
