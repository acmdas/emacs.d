## What’s the Matter?
Fri, 11 Jan 2019

“A naive understanding of materialism attributes to it a naive understanding of matter.  Matter, common sense says, is more or less the way it appears to us in ordinary experience.  It is solid, colored stuff that always tastes, smells, sounds, and feels a certain way.  Materialism, on a naïve understanding, is the view that everything that exists is like that.  Even unobservable particles are assumed to be tiny solid, colored objects that have their own tastes, smells, sounds, and feels to them.  Like little stones or marbles.

“Of course, this is all wrong.”—[Edward Feser](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2019/01/materialism-subverts-itself.html)

A pretty “Barfieldian” statement for someone who seems determined to ignore Barfield, even when his name is mentioned dozens of times by his commenters. Well, ‘philosophers’ are like that.

## That Antichrist Feeling
Sun, 13 Jan 2019

“Surface plausibility, reasonableness, persuasiveness, enjoyability... yet all the time, underneath, nagging away at me—there a revulsion, a rising tide of suspicion. The ‘balance’ of ‘evidence’ suggests that these are ‘well-meaning’ people, saying things that have ‘some value’... yet from the start, and all the time, there is this drum-beat of inner rejection.

“This is what I call That Antichrist feeling—that sense that I am here dealing with an Antichrist phenomenon...

“It is the knowledge of my own heart that I am dealing with some person, institution or product that has (to some degree—perhaps unconsciously to itself) a rotten, corrupt, dishonest, manipulative heart. That is pretending to be on the side of God, while actually working against God... That is pretending to be on the side of God in order to work against God.”—[Bruce Charlton](http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/that-antichrist-feeling.html)

## Justice or Love
Sun, 13 Jan 2019

“It is going-against a very mainstream—especially Protestant—view of Christianity (and the emphasis of the Apostle Paul) when I say Christianity is not—or is hardly at all—about justice.

“Indeed, quite the opposite: the promise of Christ is that salvation comes to all who follow him in love—and that is a massive short-circuit of anything like justice.”—[Bruce Charlton](http://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/01/christianity-is-not-much-about-justice.html)

Reminds me of the AA saying, “Good thing that God’s love is greater than His sense of justice—I’d hate to think where I’d be if I got what I deserve!”

## Modern Lit
Sun, 13 Jan 2019

&ldquo;The intelligentsia was driven to create literary modernism by a profound loathing of ordinary common readers. The intellectuals feared the masses not because they were illiterate but because, by the early twentieth century, they were becoming more literate, thanks to public education, adult education, scholarships, and cheap editions of the great books.

“If more and more working people were reading the classics, if they were closing the cultural gap between themselves and the middle classes, how could intellectuals preserve their elite status as arbiters of taste and custodians of rare knowledge? They had to create a new body of modernist literature which was deliberately made so difficult and obscure that the average reader did not understand it.”—[Jonathan Rose](https://daily.jstor.org/was-modernism-meant-to-keep-the-working-classes-out/)

This explains Virginia Woolf, Stein and Pound. And a lot of Joyce, Kafka, Eliot. Not to mention a lot of newer stuff. Or is it just me?

## The State of Current Science
Tue, 15 Jan 2019

“Modern, Linear Faustian Science has run it’s course. The decline is obviously visible when the spokesmanship passes from Albert Einstein to Carl Sagan to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. It’s been about 40 years since we really smashed through any scientific barriers.”—[Jonathan Wilkinson](http://www.amerika.org/politics/periscope-january-11-2019/)

## Judging
Fri, 18 Jan 2019

“Today’s ‘let’s all get along, not judge or challenge anyone’ groupthink also reminds me of a major scene sequence in Milos Forman’s adaptation of Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel *One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest*.

“Jack Nicholson portrays R.P. McMurphy, a good time Charlie with authority figure issues. He’s playing crazy at a maximum-security insane asylum to get out of a work detail jail sentence. Years ago, they sentenced petty criminals to hard labor. I remember as a kid being in the backseat driving South and watching chain gangs cutting overgrown brush on the median of I95—Donn Pearce must have seen them too. He wrote *Cool Hand Luke*.

“McMurphy’s Moriarty is Nurse Ratched, the head nurse in the asylum. Louise Fletcher played this role so brilliantly—all ice and pursed lips—she had difficulty finding work after winning the Oscar for it.

“One afternoon, during an interminable group therapy session, McMurphy requests that the guys be allowed to watch the World Series that evening. Knowing that the last thing the other men would want to do is stand up and challenge the way she rules her kingdom, Ratched sees an opportunity to put McMurphy in his place.

“She’ll put the request up to a vote.

“McMurphy sticks his hand up to vote ‘yea’ assuming that his fellow patients will come to the same conclusion that he has.  By simply raising their arms, together the men can let this lady know that denying a simple pleasure like watching a ball game to a bunch of lunatics is absurd.

“Which one of you nuts has any guts?

“The needy fuser Cheswick is the only other one who has the courage to challenge Nurse Ratched&rsquo;s command. Meeting adjourned. The men are then shuttled into the shower room for their evening cleaning. McMurphy is out of his mind with anger.

“If you’re a writer, this scene is a perfect example of a set-up that dramatically portrays a character’s inner change.  How does Ken Kesey pay it off?

“From the first moment McMurphy lays eyes on Ratched, the reader/viewer knows he judges her as rotten to the core. McMurphy is not afraid to judge. His problem is that he acts on his judgments too quickly. That’s what got him in the clink in the first place.

“In the nuthouse, though, he is forced to keep the judgment to himself. He’s supposed to be crazy! And to McMurphy, only crazy people don’t judge, so he shouldn’t either.

&ldquo;But when the evidence of Ratched&rsquo;s evil is incontrovertible to him, he can&rsquo;t help himself but act. He&rsquo;s the novel&rsquo;s protagonist. He&rsquo;s the hero. If he doesn&rsquo;t act on his judgments, there&rsquo;s no story.

&ldquo;Kesey could have made any number of choices with this scene. He could have had McMurphy act selfishly, like a child, and physically attack a guard or an inmate or himself. Something the character has a reputation for doing earlier in his life.

&ldquo;Instead, for the first time (and the perfect time) Kesey has his character act beyond himself. He changes his behavior. McMurphy sees that these men have it within themselves to judge Ratched as a tyrant. If he can make them understand how important it is to make a judgment and to act on that judgment&mdash;even if it puts them in harm&rsquo;s way&mdash;he will help them. And helping them will help him bring down tyranny. He&rdquo;ll win.

&ldquo;McMurphy, already known as a consummate hustler, challenges all of the men to take a bet. He puts all of his money on his succeeding. He will pick up a thousand pound marble bathroom vanity, throw it through the barred window, walk to a nearby bar with his buddy Cheswick, wet his whistle and watch Mickey Mantle play in the World Series&rdquo;¦Who wants some of this action?

&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so convincing that only the most cynical among them take his bet.

&ldquo;Playing McMurphy as only he could play him, Jack Nicholson grabs the edges of the vanity, squats and surges into the plumbing. He turns blue from effort.  He commits to the action, gives it his best shot. When he&rsquo;s drenched with sweat, spent and defeated, he walks out of the room.  But not before turning to the stunned assemblage and saying:

&ldquo;&ldquo;At least I tried.&rdquo;

&ldquo;As a child in the 60s and 70s, I was raised on stories like this. (I wish we had more of them today) And they&rdquo;ve had a profound influence. This is why art is so important.

&ldquo;These stories taught me that to passively disengage for fear of reprisal is cowardly. Making a judgment, taking a stand and then acting against an injustice or acting to support excellence is the stuff of the everyman hero.&rdquo;&mdash;[Shawn Coyne](https://stevenpressfield.com/2019/01/art-and-polarity/)

## Problems and Boundaries
Fri, 18 Jan 2019

&ldquo;All problems have solutions.

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes them problems.

&ldquo;The solution might involve trade-offs or expenses that you don&rsquo;t want to incur. You might choose not to solve the problem. But there is a solution. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t found it yet. Perhaps you need to do more research or make some tradeoffs in what you&rdquo;re hoping for.

&ldquo;If there is no solution, then it&rsquo;s not a problem.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regrettable situation. It&rsquo;s a boundary condition. It&rsquo;s something you&rdquo;ll need to live with.

&ldquo;Which might be no fun, but there&rsquo;s no sense in worrying about it or spending time or money on it, because it&rsquo;s not a problem.

&ldquo;&ldquo;I want to go to the wedding, but it&rsquo;s a thousand miles away.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a problem. You can solve it with a plane ticket and some cancelled plans.

&ldquo;&ldquo;I want to go to the wedding, but I&rdquo;m not willing to cancel my meeting.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not a problem. That&rsquo;s an unavoidable conflict. If you need to violate a law of physics to get out of a situation, it&rsquo;s not a problem. But you&rdquo;ve already given up turning it into a problem, so it doesn&rsquo;t pay to pretend it&rsquo;s solvable.

&ldquo;Once we can walk away from unsolvable situations that pretend to be problems, we can focus our energy on the real problems in front of us.&rdquo;&mdash;[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/01/problems-and-boundaries/)

## Joining Forces
Wed, 23 Jan 2019

 &ldquo;There are plagues, and there are victims, and it's the duty of good men not to join forces with the plagues.&rdquo;&mdash;Albert Camus, <em>The Plague</em>

## Incredibly Stupid Smart People
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;The great Greg Cochran will often point out that a smart person is someone who says smart things, but more important, they don&rsquo;t say many dumb things. Everyone, no matter how smart, will get a dumb idea in their head or get carried away and say something stupid on occasion. It&rsquo;s just not common with smart people, at least not as common as it is with dumb people. Being smart is as much the absence of stupidity as it is getting right answers or having a long list of brilliant insights.

&ldquo;This comes up often in public discussion of the human sciences. It is remarkable how often an allegedly smart person will say things that are laughably wrong about something in biology or human evolution.&rdquo;
It's worth reading the rest at: [The Z Man](http://thezman.com/wordpress/?p=16243) blog.

## Equality (outside mathematics)
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Equality (outside mathematics) is a purely social conception. It applies to man as a political and economic animal. It has no place in the world of the mind. Beauty is not democratic; she reveals herself more to the few than to the many, more to the persistent and disciplined seekers than to the careless. Virtue is not democratic; she is achieved by those who pursue her more hotly than most men. Truth is not democratic; she demands special talents and special industry in those to whom she gives her favors. Political democracy is doomed if it tries to extend its demand for equality into these higher spheres. Ethical, intellectual, or aesthetic democracy is death.&rdquo;&mdash;C.S. Lewis, 1944

## Democratic Education
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;Democratic education, says Aristotle, ought to mean, not the education which democrats like, but the education which will preserve democracy. Until we have realized that the two things do not necessarily go together we cannot think clearly about education.&rdquo;&mdash;C.S. Lewis

## Collectives
Thu, 24 Jan 2019

&ldquo;As long as we are thinking of natural values we must say that the sun looks down on nothing half so good as a household laughing together over a meal, or two friends talking over a pint of beer, or a man alone reading a book that interests him; and that all economies, politics, laws, armies, and institutions, save insofar as they prolong and multiply such scenes, are a mere ploughing the sand and sowing the ocean, a meaningless vanity and vexation of the spirit. Collective activities are, of course, necessary, but this is the end to which they are necessary.&rdquo;&mdash;C.S. Lewis, &ldquo;Membership&rdquo; in <em>The Weight of Glory</em>

## Lucifer and Ahriman
Wed, 30 Jan 2019

&ldquo;The aim of Lucifer is to conserve the past too long; to maintain, in the present, conditions that rightly obtained in the past, but should now be superseded. He adores tradition. In particular he seeks to maintain the permeation of the mind by the 'given', the physical, the instinctive warmth, which men bring with them from the past and must indeed use, but which should no longer permeate, or at least not involuntarily, their mental powers. You and I, my friend, have watched him at work already, for we have seen him trying to preserve into your time the psychology and the social patterns of the Gabriel age.

&ldquo;And what is the function, or the aim, of Ahriman?

&ldquo;You must distinguish the function from the aim. It is the aims of both beings that we are at present concerned with. Their aim is to oppose those whom it will suffice for the present to call the true gods; but their <em>function</em> is to serve these gods against their will, and by means of that very opposition. Do not take this lightly, or repeat it glibly. The aim of Ahriman is to anticipate the future, but which can only appear in the present as a wicked caricature. In pursuit of this aim he will persuade you, if he can, to eradicate the past instead of transforming it. He abhors tradition. History is his bane. He operates, in the present age, principally in the field of mind, leaving the feelings for Lucifer to exploit. He freezes. His purpose is to destroy everything in human thinking which depends on a certain warmth, to replace wonder by sophistication, courtesy by vulgarity, understanding by calculation, imagination by statistics.&rdquo;&mdash;Owen Barfield, <em>Unancestral Voice</em>

## Politics
Wed, 30 Jan 2019

&ldquo;I am suggesting therefore that what we have to think of, and what future legislation must somehow learn to deal with, is not so much a public opinion that is sharply divided in two as it is two different publics: an A public and a B public. Or that, if this is not already the case, it is rapidly becoming so; and it seems that in the near future it will be so. Anyone who has felt the pulse, so to speak, of the intellectual climate in the English-speaking world, and of the changes that have been occurring in it over the last forty or fifty years, is likely to be impressed by the circumstance that, even at the philosophical level&mdash;even, that is, when a <em>bona fide</em> attempt is made to bridge the communication gap by recognizing the presuppositions, formulating them, debating them&mdash;it generally turns out to be impossible.&rdquo;&mdash;Owen Barfield, [*The Politics of Abortion*](http://www.owenbarfield.org/the-politics-of-abortion/)

## Being an Ent
Sat, 02 Feb 2019

“‘And what about yourself?’ asked Merry.

“‘Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,’ said Treebeard; ‘they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody’s side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even Elves nowadays...’”—J.R.R. Tolkien, *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, book 3, chapter IV

## Location, Location, Location
Sat, 02 Feb 2019

At least a few of my strong memories are strongly associated with a very particular place. The bed at nine-mile, the sofa on Stanley street, the entry hall on Dale Drive.

This last with just a flash, that "we" could easily take a "wrong turn" in our thoughts and carry merrily on down a "wrong" path. "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood...and that has made all the difference."

Brought to mind several times recently reading Barfield's writing about the history of consciousness.

## Miracles
Sat, 09 Feb 2019

&ldquo;They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.&rdquo;&mdash;Shakespeare, *All&rsquo;s Well That Ends Well*

## God Is Not
Thu, 14 Feb 2019

&ldquo;God is not a lesson plan or an intellectual construct. God is not one more thing to do well at, God is someone&mdash;or something&mdash;we meet, each in our own way.&rdquo;&mdash;Julia Cameron, <em>God Is No Laughing Matter</em>

## Seen Online
Mon, 25 Feb 2019

youngster: “You were online 30 years ago?  Was it different back then?”

me: *silence*

youngster: “Well?”

me: “We didn't pretend we were doing anything important.”

David's comment: well, some of it seemed important—it was for work, after all, but mostly, yeah.

## Fathers and Sons
Fri, 01 Mar 2019

“And in that moment Sherman made the terrible discovery that men make about their fathers sooner or later. For the first time he realized that the man before him was not an aging father but a boy, a boy much like himself, a boy who grew up and had a child of his own and, as best he could, out of a sense of duty and, perhaps, love, adopted a role called Being a Father so that his child would have something mythical and infinitely important: a Protector, who would keep a lid on all the chaotic and catastrophic possibilities of life. And now that boy, that good actor, had grown old and fragile and tired, wearier than ever at the thought of trying to hoist the Protector&rsquo;s armor back onto his shoulders again, now, so far down the line.”—Tom Wolfe *Bonfire of the Vanities*

## Boring and Dangerous
Wed, 06 Mar 2019

“Life is intrinsically, well, boring and dangerous at the same time. At any given moment the floor may open up. Of course, it almost never does; that’s what makes it so boring.”—Edward J. Gorey

## Magic
Mon, 11 Mar 2019

“You could say that ‘magic’ is a recognition that you have been underestimating the world, assuming that it is boring and limited when it is your own mind that is bored and limited. And this is important, for it brings the great fundamental insight, the insight that has come to all mystics and poets : that a large part of man&rsquo;s misery and pain is his own fault. For nearly three thousand years, cynical philosophers have been declaring that human life is disappointing and brief and miserable, and that the wise man has no objection to dying. But moments of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; bring a clear recognition that the world ‘out there’ is infinitely interesting—so interesting that if we could ‘turn on’ the magic at will, we would probably live for ever—or at least, want to. The magic doesn’t get in past our senses, which have thick filters on them. Blake recognised that it is as if man lived in a cold, damp cave, when outside there is warm sunlight and fresh air. ‘Five windows light the caverned man, through one he breathes the air . . .’”—William Arkle *A Geography of Consciousness*

## Ressentiment
Sun, 17 Mar 2019

&ldquo;Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such, are normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite.&rdquo;&mdash;Max Scheler [*Ressentiment*](https://mercaba.org/SANLUIS/Filosofia/autores/Contempor%C3%A1nea/Scheller/Ressentiment.pdf)

## Increasingly Meaningless Words and Phrases
Thu, 21 Mar 2019

&ldquo;As far as I can tell, the words contained in the list below no longer define what they are meant to define.

* moral authority
* freedom
* human rights
* democracy
* values
* justice
* philanthropist

&ldquo;I hear these words repeated ad nauseam every day, yet I rarely perceive the things they are meant to delineate. What a truly confusing time to be alive.&rdquo;&mdash;[Francis Berger](https://www.francisberger.com/bergers-blog/increasingly-amorphous-words-and-phrases)

## Axiomatic
Sun, 24 Mar 2019

&ldquo;There are some things that cannot be verified, or falsified. These would include all axioms of logic; even those of post-modern &ldquo;paraconsistent&rdquo; logics, wherein the very Law of Non-Contradiction is (implausibly) denied, but which are axiomatic on their own terms. We are out the door of &ldquo;science&rdquo; when we discuss logic; or the principles of mathematics for that matter. All we can say is that the world makes sense on axioms; and not otherwise.

&ldquo;For science, or human knowledge more broadly, God is not an hypothesis, but an Axiom. Start in Aristotle, if you will, to see that the world has no purchase on sense, without the Unmoved Mover. The &ldquo;Five Ways&rdquo; by which the inevitability of God was demonstrated by Thomas Aquinas, and the related ways in which this was done by others before and after him, are easily misunderstood, because they are not proofs of an hypothesis but recursions. They show that, without that &ldquo;God Axiom,&rdquo; there can be no causation, no change, no being in itself, no gradation, no direction to an end. We need a Still Point, from which to depart. It cannot be hypothesized. It is too simple for that. You need to assume it even to contradict it.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/03/23/the-cosmic-duh/)

## Sloth
Mon, 08 Apr 2019

&ldquo;One of the more misunderstood of the cardinal sins is sloth. Most see it merely as laziness, but there is more to it than that. Let&rsquo;s take a moment and consider some aspects of this cardinal sin.

&ldquo;The Greek word we translate as sloth is á¼€ÎºÎ·Î´Î¯Î± akedia (a = absence + kedos = care), meaning indifference or negligence. St. Thomas Aquinas speaks of sloth as sorrow for spiritual good. By it, we shun spiritual good as too toilsome (cf Summa Theologica II-II 35,2).

&ldquo;Some modern commentators describe sloth as a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; feeling. Some even say it is a kind of falling out of love with God and the things of God (cf Rev 2:4). On account of sloth, the idea of right living and the gift of a transformed humanity inspires not joy, but aversion or even disgust because it is seen as too difficult or as requiring the setting aside of currently enjoyed or sinful pleasures. Through sloth, many experience sorrow rather than joy or zeal in following God and receiving a transformed human life. They are distressed at the prospect of what might have to occur should they embrace the faith more deeply.

&ldquo;Sloth also tends to dismiss the power of grace, focusing instead on the &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; or effort involved in walking in the Christian way.

&ldquo;Sloth is not merely laziness; it is more properly understood as sorrow or indifference. While sloth may sometimes look like boredom and a casual laziness toward attaining spiritual good, it can also be manifested by a frantic &ldquo;busyness&rdquo; with worldly things so as to avoid spiritual questions or living a reflective life.&rdquo;&mdash;[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2019/04/seven-deadly-sins-sloth/)

## History
Tue, 09 Apr 2019

&ldquo;What with history being rewritten so often, nobody knows what is true anymore. They lose track of who is an enemy and who an ally. It&rsquo;s that kind of story.&rdquo;

&ldquo;&ldquo;They rewrite history.&rdquo;

&ldquo;&ldquo;Robbing people of their actual history is the same as robbing them of part of themselves. It&rsquo;s a crime.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Fuka-Eri thought about that for a moment.

&ldquo;Tengo went on, &ldquo;Our memory is made up of our individual memories and our collective memories. The two are intimately linked. And history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us&mdash;is rewritten&mdash;we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.&rdquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Haruki Murakami <em>1Q84</em>


## The Second Bowl
Fri, 12 Apr 2019

&ldquo;I broke two bowls today.

&ldquo;I was emptying the dishwasher, holding both small clean bowls in one hand. One of them slipped, and I watched, aghast, as it started to fall in slow motion toward the hard kitchen floor.

&ldquo;In a valiant but vain attempt to miraculously catch the bowl, I dropped the second one as well.

&ldquo;Now both were gone.

&ldquo;Often, the best thing to do with a lost cause is to let it go. Because pursuing it gets in the way of the causes you haven&rsquo;t lost yet.&rdquo;&mdash;[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/04/the-second-bowl/)

## Ignorance
Sat, 13 Apr 2019

&ldquo;Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.&rdquo;&mdash;Daniel Kahneman

## Audacity
Sat, 13 Apr 2019

“If you are inclined - late in life though it be - to reconnoitre a foreign sphere of limitless extent, then be persuaded that the first quality that is needed is Audacity. There really is no time for the deliberate approach...We must not be too ambitious. We cannot aspire to masterpieces. We may content ourselves with a joy ride. And for this Audacity is the only ticket.”&mdash;W. S. Churchill&mdash;*Painting as a Pastime*

## Scare Quotes
Wed, 17 Apr 2019

Students exist who will scare quote “right,” “wrong,” “good,” and “evil,” as though one were talking about gnomes, trolls and “‘cultural’ studies.” — [Richard Cocks](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/04/17/berdyaev-summer-camp/)

## Deus vult - an Easter Morning Thought
Sun, Apr 21, 2019

One of those “blasts from the past” that seem like original-to-me thoughts (as in I don’t remember reading them first) which I recall with complete visual memory of where I was when they first came to me. Location is the office at Saint Saviour’s Pro-Cathedral in Nelson, BC. Late winter or very early spring (slushy snow in the street), early 1980s.

“Christ didn’t die to convince God to love us — He died to convince us that God loved us.”

I am, in general, disinclined to give too much value to detailed theological/philosophical analysis of the inner-workings of the Creator — the interaction of the Persons of the Trinity, which Person spoke to Moses, Who divided the waters, etc., so I won’t further analyze or defend that thought. John 14:15 seems an adequate entry point to a Holy life: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”

We can analyze what the commandments are, and how to keep them in a particular circumstance without delving into why He considers them important, or which Person originated or communicated them. “Our Lord Jesus Christ said: Hear O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love your neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets”

## Pagan Gods
Sun, 21 Apr 2019

“MEN do not live long without gods; when the gods of the New Paganism come they will not be merely insufficient, as were the gods of Greece, nor merely false; they will be evil. One might put it in a sentence, and say that the New Paganism, foolishly expecting satisfaction, will fall, before it knows where it is, into Satanism.” — Hilaire Belloc: *Essays of a Catholic*.

## Owen Barfield
Sat, 27 Apr 2019

Owen Barfield (1898–1997)
Our destiny is to become both conscious and free.

Barfield was writing for everybody and for all time — his core concern was nothing less than the divine destiny of each individual person and of all people collectively.

Barfield's immediate relevance is profound; it is to solve the core problem of modern times - which is 'alienation': i.e. the deep sense of meaninglessness, purposelessness, and isolation from people and things.

The understanding which makes this possible is that history, the present and the future can be understood as aiming at both consciousness and freedom (where consciousness means awareness of our thinking and ourselves, and freedom refers to free will, or human agency).

Barfield's scheme is that humans began as conscious-but-not-free; and we evolved — evolved in the sense of changing by unfolding according to a (divine) developmental plan — to become free but not conscious (which is where we are now, in modern times — unaware of meaning, purpose, relation) — and we ought to be aiming at the condition where we are both self-aware and fully-conscious. Engaged with (and participating in) reality as free agents.

Even more briefly, humanity began as conscious, became free; and is destined to become both — simultaneously.

Barfield proposes real, coherent, and clear answers to the most fundamental problems.

## No Big Thing
Wed, 1 May, 2019

&ldquo;I have found that one of my favorite quotes from St. Augustine is not all that well known. Here it is in Latin, followed by my own translation:

Quod minimum, minimum est,
Sed in minimo fidelem esse,
magnum est.

What is a little thing, is (just) a little thing.
But to be faithful in a little thing
is a great thing.&rdquo;&mdash;[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2019/05/greatness-little-things-reflection-quote-st-augustine/) (from St. Augustine’s De Doctrina Christiana, IV, 35)

## The Past
Sat, 4 May, 2019

"The past is a foreign country; They do things different there."&mdash;L. P. Hartley <em>The Go-Between</em>

## Change
Sun, 5 May, 2019

"A changeless society would be as intolerable for people as the present society of constant change. Convivial reconstruction requires limits on the rate of compulsory change. An unlimited rate of change makes lawful community meaningless. Law is based on the retrospective judgment of peers about circumstances that occur ordinarily and are likely to occur again. If the rate of change which affects all circumstances accelerates beyond some point, such judgments cease to be valid. Lawful society breaks down. Social control does not accommodate community participation and becomes the function of experts. Educators define how people are to be trained and retrained throughout their lives—shaped and reshaped until they fit the demands of industry and are attracted by its profits. Ideologues define what is right or wrong. The tooling of man for the milieu becomes the major industry when this milieu changes beyond a certain rate; then man’s need for language and law, for memories and myths, imposes limits to the change of tools."—Ivan Illich, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em>

## Knavish Imbecility
Sun, 5 May, 2019

“The Catholic Church is an institution I am bound to hold divine — but for unbelievers a proof of its divinity might be found in the fact that no merely human institution conducted with such knavish imbecility would have lasted a fortnight.”&mdash;Hilaire Belloc (A comment made to William Temple, quoted in The Life of Hilaire Belloc by Robert Speaight)

## Serenity vs Apathy
Sun, 5 May, 2019

&ldquo;Serenity is not the same as apathy, although both words denote a state that is beyond caring. One difference is that serenity is cheerful and apathy is gloomy. The serene man has overcome the world, whereas the apathetic man has been overcome by it.  Both men have lost their ambitions, but the serene man left them behind, like a newspaper on a park bench, whereas the apathetic man had them torn from his fingers in a desperate but losing fight with a band of wild banditti.&rdquo;&mdash;[J. M. Smith](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/05/05/divest-yourself-or-be-divested/)

## Regardless Power
Sun, 5 May, 2019

&ldquo;I am, however, equally troubled by another specter, another threat. I'm not sure what to call it, perhaps the threat of emancipatory technics, the emancipation here being something like the total emancipation from our embodied-in-the-world human condition. Together they constitute what I think of as the Charybdis and Scylla of the modern techo-social order. What I have in mind here is the development and deployment of technology without any regard for the givenness of our condition (any, I should note, does a lot of work in this sentence). We might also refer to the temptation of what Albert Borgmann has termed "regardless power" or, as Katherine Hayles once put it, to view our bodies as "fashion accessories rather than the ground of being." It seems to me that such power is, yes, problematic whether it is authoritarian or democratic. I am, in other words, indiscriminately suspicious of post-humanist fantasies whatever their ideological sources. 

&ldquo;I suppose one way of thinking about all of this is to ask whether it might not be best to respect the integrity of each component in the circuit I described above: mind, body, technology, world. That presupposes, of course, that we might be able to arrive at some meaningful understanding of what such integrity might entail. (Needless to say, I think we are just beginning a hard lesson in what happens when we do not respect the integrity of the world, a lesson which will not be halted by our inability to get a theoretical handle on nature's integrity.) Or, to put it another way, should we yield to the temptation of allowing our minds and our technology to act in tandem without any regard to the limits implicit in our being bodies in the world?&rdquo;&mdash;[L. M. Sacasas](https://tinyletter.com/lmsacasas/letters/the-convivial-society-no-14)

## Creeds Must Disagree
Sun, 5 May 2019

&ldquo;CREEDS must disagree: it is the whole fun of the thing. If I think the universe is triangular, and you think it is square, there cannot be room for two universes. We may argue politely, we may argue humanely, we may argue with great mutual benefit; but, obviously, we must argue. Modern toleration is really a tyranny. It is a tyranny because it is a silence. To say that I must not deny my opponent's faith is to say I must not discuss it . . . It is absurd to have a discussion on Comparative Religions if you don't compare them.&rdquo;&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *Illustrated London News, Oct. 10, 1908.*

## The Myth as Enemy
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate, contrived and dishonest -- but the myth -- persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.&rdquo;&mdash;John F. Kennedy *Commencement Address at Yale University, 11 June, 1962*

## The Human Mind Needs
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;NOW the human mind needs&mdash;─if it would be united to God&mdash;the guidance of the things of sense; for as the apostle says to the Romans (1:20): &lsquo;The invisible things of him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.&rsquo; Hence in divine worship  it is necessary to make use of certain corporal acts, so that by their means, as by certain signs, man&rsquo;s mind may be stirred up to those spiritual acts whereby it is knit to God. Consequently religion has certain interior acts which are its chief ones and which essentially belong to it; but it has also external which are secondary and which are subordinated to the interior acts.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas: *Summa Theologica, II-II, 81, 7.*

## Romanticizing the Past
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;I understand the impulse, I really do. I think it was from Alan Jacobs that I first learned about the poet W. H. Auden’s distinction between those whose tendency is to look longingly back at some better age in the past and those who look hopefully toward some ideal future:  Arcadians and Utopians respectively, he called them. Auden took these to be matters of temperament. If so, then I would readily admit to being temperamentally Arcadian. For that reason, I think I well understand the temptation and try to be on guard against it.&rdquo;&mdash;[L. M. Sacasas](https://thefrailestthing.com/2019/02/06/dont-romanticize-the-present/)

## More Huxley than Orwell
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;*Fahrenheit 451* isn’t really about censorship, after all, and it’s unfortunate that the novel has been reduced to that theme in the popular imagination.

&ldquo;Bradbury makes clear that the firemen who famously start fires to burn books are doing so only long after people stopped reading books of their own accord as other forms of media came to dominate their experience. Actually, to be more precise, they did not stop reading altogether. They stopped reading certain kinds of books: the ones that made demands of the reader, intellectual, emotional, moral demands that might upset their fragile sense of well-being.

&ldquo;*Fahrenheit 451*, in other words, is more Huxley than Orwell.&rdquo;&mdash;[L. M. Sacasas](https://thefrailestthing.com/2018/06/15/were-reading-fahrenheit-451-wrong/)

## Gell-Mann Amnesia
Mon, 6 May 2019

&ldquo;Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them.

&ldquo;In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.&rdquo;&mdash;Michael Crichton

## Every Schoolboy Knows
Mon, 6 May 2019

From Gregory Bateson's *Mind and Nature*

&ldquo;Official education was telling people almost nothing of the nature of all those things on the seashores and in the redwood forests, in the deserts and the plains.  Even grown-up persons with children of their own cannot give a reasonable account fo concepts such as entropy, sacrament, syntax, number, quantity, pattern, linear relation, name, class, relevance, energy, redundancy, force, probability, parts, whole, information, tautology, homology, mass (either Newtonian or Christian), explanation, description, rule of dimensions, logical type, metaphor, topology, and so on.  What are butterflies? What are starfish?  What are beauty and ugliness?&rdquo; p. 3

Chapter II, &ldquo;Every Schoolboy Knows&rdquo;

Quoting Macauley:
&ldquo;Every schoolboy knows who imprisoned Montezuma and who strangled Atahualpa.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Those who lack all idea that it is possible to be wrong can learn nothing but know-how.&rdquo; p.28

&ldquo;It is worthwhile to attempt a tentative recognition of certain basic presuppositons which all minds must share or, conversely, to define mind by listing a number of such basic communicational characteristics:&rdquo; p.29

Section Headings:

1. Science never proves anything.

2. The map is not the territory, and the name is not the thing.

3. There is no objective experience.

4. The processes of image formation are unconscious.

5. The division of the perceived universe into parts and wholes is convenient and may be necessary, but no necessity determines how it shall be done.

6. Divergent sequences are unpredictable.

7. Convergent sequences are predictable.

8. "Nothing will come of nothing."

9. Number is different from quantity.

10. Quantity does not determine pattern.

11. There are no "monotone" values in biology.

12. Sometimes, small is beautiful.

13. Logic is a poor model of cause and effect.

14. Causality does not work backward.

15. Language commonly stresses only one side of any interaction.

16. "Stability" and "change" describe parts of our descriptions.

Bateson is another connection that I owe to The Whole Earth Catalog. I believe that I purchased and first read Steps in about 1984, then reread and made these notes in early October of 2008. Reading them now, I'm struck by how closely they seem to relate to Owen Barfield's writing.

## A Strong Antidote
Wed, May 8 2019

&ldquo;The message of the Book of Revelation is a strong antidote to times like these, now, in the past, and in the future: be strong, be prepared, and be willing to suffer, realizing that no matter how powerful and glamorous evil may seem, Jesus is the victor. We must persevere and realize that we are swept up into a cosmic battle that is much larger than our current situation but that reaches us nonetheless. We must choose sides. Don’t think that you can sit on the fence. Satan owns the fence; he will come for you and say, “You belong to me.”&rdquo;&mdash;[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2019/05/book-revelation-sure-guide-really-going-2/)

## Replication Crisis
Thu, 9 May 2019

&ldquo;Most scientists are not corrupt but doing good science is hard, even for very intelligent and diligent people. I also suspect most researchers have inadequate education in statistics.

&ldquo;The pressure to publish, the pressure to publish conclusions that won&rsquo;t get you ostracized of your scientific community, the pressure to make whoever funds your research happy, are all corrupting influences on science.

&ldquo;If a theory makes reliable predictions, and those predictions are used by engineers, I consider it to be solid science. Otherwise, it’s most likely bunk.&rdquo;&mdash;Commenter jermo sapiens at [SlateStarCodex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/)


## *Imitatio Christi*
Thu, 9 May 2019

&ldquo;Ronald Knox said, of *The Imitation of Christ*, that anyone who claims to be “fond” of it is either a saint, or he is lying. This most formidable of late mediaeval spiritual guides — to call it a “devotional book” is to set out in the wrong direction — was meant as an acid bath. It strips off the skin of one’s vanity, then claws at what lies underneath. The charm in the writing lands like salt. There are no “happyface” moments, unless one counts a surprising chapter, whose number I won’t give lest some innocent try to start there. That chapter can be read as a transcription of mystical experience, along the unitive way. But I take it not as “encouragement” but as grounding and orientation, for the book is deadly serious beginning to end, and the point of it is to point the reader where the Christian must go: on a path that unavoidably includes “the dark night of the soul.”&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/08/tough-loves/)

## Longing for Man
Mon, 13 May 2019

&ldquo;But in God there is a passionate and anguished longing for man. In God there is a tragic deficiency which is satisfied by the great gain of man’s birth in Him. The mystics taught the mystery of God’s birth in man. But there is another mystery; that of man’s birth in God. There is a summons, a call in man, for God to be born in him. This is the mystery of Christianity, the mystery of Christ, which is unknown to the Hindu mystics, to Plotinus, or to any of the abstract monistic mystics. God and man are greater than God alone. The substantial multinomial being revealed in One is greater than a One undifferentiated. Only the myth of God’s longing for man and for man’s love can bring us near to the final mystery.&rdquo;&mdash;Nikolai Berdyaev *The Meaning of the Creative Act*

## Metaphysic Mathematics
Mon, 13 May 2019

&ldquo;The crux of today's cosmological paradigm is that in order to maintain a mathematically unified theory valid for the entire universe, we must accept that 95 percent of our cosmos is furnished by completely unknown elements and forces for which we have no empirical evidence whatsoever. For a scientist to be confident of this picture requires an exceptional faith in the power of mathematical unification.&rdquo;&mdash;Bjorn Ekeberg [*Scientific American*](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/cosmology-has-some-big-problems/)

## Hospitality
Sat, 18 May 2019

**Illich**: Hospitality was a condition consequent on a good society in politics, *politaea*, and by now might be the starting point of *politaea*, of politics. But this is difficult because hospitality requires a threshold over which I can lead you — and TV, internet, newspaper, the idea of communication, abolished the walls and therefore also the friendship, the possibility of leading somebody over the door. Hospitality requires a table around which you can sit and if people get tired they can sleep. You have to belong to a subculture to say, we have a few mattresses here. It's still considered highly improper to conceive of this as the ideal moments in a day or a year. Hospitality is deeply threatened by the idea of personality, of scholastic status. I do think that if I had to choose one word to which hope can be tied it is hospitality. A practice of hospitality— recovering threshold, table, patience, listening, and from there generating seedbeds for virtue and friendship on the one hand — on the other hand radiating out for possible community, for rebirth of community.

&mdash;Ivan Illich [Interview with Jerry Brown](http://www.wtp.org/archive/transcripts/ivan_illich_jerry.html)

## In-group, out-group
Sat, 18 May 2019

&ldquo;...the problem is that when we encounter opposing views in the age and context of social media, it’s not like reading them in a newspaper while sitting alone. It’s like hearing them from the opposing team while sitting with our fellow fans in a football stadium. Online, we’re connected with our communities, and we seek approval from our like-minded peers. We bond with our team by yelling at the fans of the other one. In sociology terms, we strengthen our feeling of &lsquo;in-group&rsquo; belonging by increasing our distance from and tension with the &lsquo;out-group&rsquo;&mdash;us versus them.&rdquo;&mdash;[Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611806/how-social-media-took-us-from-tahrir-square-to-donald-trump/)

## Creating Need
Sat, 18 May 2019

**Brown**: So Deschooling was based on the insight that the school industry teaches people, not teaches them but manipulates them, into thinking that they have certain needs that the school itself alone can satisfy?

**Illich**: That they have needs. Not all people whom I knew as a young man had needs. We were hungry but we couldn't translate the hunger into a need for food stuff. They were hungry for a tortilla, for comida, not calories. The idea that people are born with needs, that needs can be translated into rights, that these rights can be translated into entitlements, is a development of the modern world and it's reasonable, it's acceptable, it's obvious only for people who have had some of their educational needs awakened or created, then satisfied and then learned that we have less than others. Schooling, which we engage in and supposedly creates equal opportunities, has become the unique, never before attempted way of dividing the whole society into classes. Everybody knows in which level of his twelve or sixteen years of schooling he has dropped out, and in addition knows what price tag is attached to the higher schooling he has gotten.

**Brown**: So you get a precise definition of where you are in the social hierarchy by how much schooling your had or how much schooling you don't have, so you didn't know you needed fourteen years and a postgraduate degree or to get out of high school depending upon where you lived.

**Illich**: It's a history of degrading the majority of people.

**Brown**: So you take somebody who's poor and you modernize the poverty by not only having a person that doesn't have a lot of material goods but now lacks the mental self-confidence that his father or grandfather had before that.

**Illich**: And I can create a world for him in which he needs constantly something which--at that time I searched for a word I didn't findd, context sensitive help. You know, when you are in front of a computer and when you are in that program and put in Word Perfect it tells you what help you need at that point at which you are. This is instructions for use. This is incorporation of teaching into the object with which you encounter at its high point. We have created a world in which people constantly are grateful if they are taken by the hand to know how to use a knife or to use the coffee maker or how to go on from here in text composing.

&mdash;Ivan Illich [Interview with Jerry Brown](http://www.wtp.org/archive/transcripts/ivan_illich_jerry.html)

## Objectify
Sat, 18 May 2019

**Illich**: ...Inevitably modern technology has polarized society. It has polluted the environment. It has disabled very simple native abilities and made them dependent on objects.

**Brown**: Like an automobile.

**Illich**: An automobile which cuts out the use value from your feet. Like an automobile which makes the world inaccessible when actually that means in Latin using your feet to get somewhere. The automobile makes it unthinkable. I recently had the question, "You're a liar!" when I said to somebody I walked down the spine of the Andes. Every Spaniard in the 16th, 17th century did that. The idea that somebody could just walk! He can jog perhaps in the morning but he can't walk anywhere! The world has become inaccessible because we drive there.

**Brown**: So the objects, like a car or even like a school, change who we are.

**Illich**: Who you are and even more deeply they change the way your senses work. Traditionally the gaze was conceived as a way of fingering, of touching. The old Greeks spoke about looking as a way of sending out my *psychopodia* [?], my soul's limbs, to touch your face and establish a relationship between the two of us which is this relationship, and this relationship was called vision. Then, after Galileo at the time of Kepler, the idea developed that the eyes are receptors into which light brings something from the outside, keeping you separate from me even when I look at you. Even if I gaze at you. Even if I enjoy your face. People began to conceive of their eyes as some kind of camera obscura. In our age people conceive of their eyes and actually use them as if they were part of a machinery. They speak about interface. Anybody who says to me, I want to have an interface with you, I say please go somewhere else, to a toilet or wherever you want, to a mirror. Anybody who says, I want to communicate with you, I say can't you talk? Can't you speak? Can't you recognize that there's a deep otherness between me and you, so deep that it would be offensive for me to be programmed in the same way you are.

## Happy Birthday to Me
Sun, 19 May 2019

I was recently informed by [David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/16/again-again/) that men (or, if you prefer, persons) of the 13th Century counted their age in moons, not years.

If that is the case, and I’ve not independently verified it, and if I’m able to do simple arithmetic on my fingers and in my head, yesterday was my 845th birthday.

In lieu of cards or gifts, please attend the most orthodox (small “O”) Christian Church of your choice.

## Somebody Gets It
Mon, 20 May 2019

“I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. they may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history. Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels that he belongs. Here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. Here at last he finds rest.”&mdash; W. Somerset Maugham, *The Moon and Sixpence* 1919

## Observations
Mon, 20 May 2019

&ldquo;The Church is not in crisis, as Cardinal Sarah was saying the other day. We are in crisis. The Devil wants us to think that God has abandoned His Church. He hasn’t. In fact, He can’t, if I may add my theological understanding of the matter. I like to quote Joan of Arc: “About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they’re just one thing, and we shouldn’t complicate the matter.” It is only when we redefine the Church, to be something it is not, that complications arise.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/20/depends-what-you-mean-by-is/)

## Going Through the Motions
Mon, 20 May 2019

&ldquo;Even going through the motions has value, when the motions are in service to a cause that is divine. Inspiration is anyway for special occasions. The Mass is valid, when we go through the motions; it was actually designed to be hard to invalidate. We needn’t bother our little heads with whether the priest is worthy. That is his business. We need only ask if we are in any way adequate to receive the Host, for the consequences of my not being worthy do not fall upon anyone else, except tangentially; and neither can my guilt be transferred to my neighbour.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/05/20/depends-what-you-mean-by-is/)

## Still Hated After All These Years
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;What greater proof of his divinity could there be than the fact that he is still resisted, even hated, after 2,000 years? Nobody hates Julius Caesar anymore; it’s pretty hard even to hate Attila the Hun, who left a lot of hard feelings in his day. But the world still hates Christ and his Church.&rdquo;&mdash;Joseph Sobran, *Subtracting Christianity: Essays on American Culture and Society*

## So Few, So Many
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;When we jumped into Sicily, the units became separated, and I couldn’t find anyone. Eventually I stumbled across two colonels, a major, three captains, two lieutenants, and one rifleman, and we secured the bridge. Never in the history of war have so few been led by so many.&rdquo;&mdash;General James Gavin, quoted in Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven *Oath of Fealty*

## Rebirth
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;In his book The Everlasting Man, G. K. Chesterton describes the power of orthodoxy to renew itself, in a chapter titled “Five Deaths of the Faith.” Christianity, he tells us, was never really reborn, because it never really died. The cultures it lived in died, so Christianity was rediscovered five times in the history of the West, as one cultural epoch was superseded by another. This happened after the fall of Rome, then in the twelfth century at the end of the feudal era, again when the medieval synthesis gave way to the secular energies of the Renaissance, again when the Renaissance fell to the new rationalism of the Enlightenment, and yet again as Enlightenment values have begun to dissolve with the arrival of our postindustrial age.&rdquo;&mdash;G. K. Chesterton, *The Everlasting Man*, 250 quoted in Robert Inchausti, *Subversive Orthodoxy*, 16

## Eckhart
Thu, 23 May 2019

&ldquo;Eckhart had neither the desire to take aught away from the content of Christianity, nor the wish to add anything to it; but he desired to bring forward this content anew in his own way. It forms no part of the spiritual needs of a personality such as he was to set up new truths of this or the other kind in the place of old ones. Such a personality has grown completely intertwined with the content which it has received from tradition; but it craves to give to this content a new form, a new life.&rdquo;&mdash;Rudolf Steiner, *Mystics of the Renaissance*

## No Matter
Sat, 25 May 2019

&ldquo;But there is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy. This is the habit of saying that his philosophy does not matter, and this is done universally in the twentieth century, in the decadence of the great revolutionary period.&rdquo;&mdash;G.K. Chesterton, *Heretics*

## Smart Dogs
Sat, 25 May 2019

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this: It takes a smart dog to hunt birds, but it takes a hunter behind him to keep him from wasting time chasing rabbits. And the hunter needs to know nearly as much as the dog.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert A. Heinlein, *Solution Unsatisfactory*

## Two Ways
Sat, 25 May 2019

&ldquo;There are but two ways of forming an opinion in science. One is the scientific method; the other, the scholastic. One can judge from experiement, or one can blindly accept authority. To the scientific mind, experimental proof is all-important, and theory is merely a convenience in description, to be junked when it no lo0nger fits. To the academic mind, authority is everything, and facts are junked when they do not fit theory laid down by authority.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert A. Heinlein, *Life-Line*

## Hard Truths
Tue, 04 Jun 2019

&ldquo;The soul … has grown aware of her obligations and observed that life is short (Job 14:5), the path leading to eternal life constricted (Mt. 7:14), the just one scarcely saved (1 Pet. 4:18), the things of the world vain and deceitful (Eccles. 1:2), that all comes to an end and fails like falling water (2 Sam. 14:14), and that the time is uncertain, the accounting strict, perdition very easy, and salvation very difficult.&rdquo;&mdash;St. John of the Cross, *Spiritual Canticle*

## Hospitality
Thu, 06 Jun 2019

&ldquo;Learned and leisurely hospitality is the only antidote to the stance of deadly cleverness that is acquired in the professional pursuit of objectively secured knowledge.

## Severe Logic
Sat, 08 Jun 2019

“At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets, he (Bowyer, Head Master of the Grammar School, Christ’s Hospital) made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons, too, which required most time and trouble to bring up so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent upon more, and more fugitive, causes.”&mdash;S. T. Coleridge, *Biographia Literaria*

## Spritual, Not Religious
Tue, 11 Jun 2019

&ldquo;A familiar A.A. clich&#233; describes the fellowship&rsquo;s program as &ldquo;spiritual rather than religious,&rdquo; and members of Alcoholics Anonymous tend to enforce this distinction vigorously upon both those who comment on their program and themselves at A.A. meetings. This deep and real concern over its image as &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; bears vivid witness to A.A.&rsquo;s authentic modernity, especially as a religious phenomenon. The mistrust of religious claims that matured in the Enlightenment has so deepened and spread that, in the twentieth centure, secularization has become the hallmark of modernity. Over those same two centuries between the Enlightenment and the present, however, the reaction of Romanticism against Enlightenment rationalism has also become culturally internalized and effectively stylized. Thus, in yet another paradox, moderns readily accept &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; even as they resolutely reject &ldquo;belief&rdquo; as a wellspring of personal action, at least so long as it does not intrude upon the autonomy of others.&rdquo;&mdash;Ernie Kurtz, *Not God*

## Lower Bodies, Higher Bodies
Sun, 16 Jun 2019

&ldquo;Now, just as there is a difference between higher and lower intellectual substances, so also is there such a difference between corporeal substances. But intellectual substances are ruled by the higher ones, since the disposition of divine providence descends proportionally to the lowest, as we have said already. Therefore, on a like basis, the lower bodies are ordered through the higher ones.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Contra Gentiles* Book 3

## Parmenides
Tue, 18 Jun 2019

&ldquo;What I am saying is this: There is internal evidence in at least one of my novels that another reality, an unchanging one, exactly as Parmenides and Plato suspected, underlies the visible phenomenal world of change, and somehow, in some way, perhaps to our surprise, we can cut through to it. Or rather, a mysterious Spirit can put us in touch with it, if it wishes us to see this permanent other landscape. Time passes, thousands of years pass, but at the same instant that we see this contemporary world, the ancient world, the world of the Bible, is concealed beneath it, still there and still real. Eternally so.&rdquo;&mdash;Philip K. Dick [How to Build a Universe That Doesn’t Fall Apart Two Days Later](https://urbigenous.net/library/how_to_build.html)

## The Resolution of Grief
Tue, 18 Jun 2019

&ldquo;A very deep form of grief is grieving over our own intuitive knowledge of our own value which we have not paid proper attention to, and we have not properly learned to use in the world for our own sake, or for the sake of others. It&rsquo;s as though the grief is about a beautiful treasure that was within our reach all the time and yet we didn&rsquo;t stretch out and use this treasure and enjoy it in the way it should be used and enjoyed.&rdquo;&mdash;William Arkle *The Great Gift*

## An Exception
Fri, 21 Jun 2019

"Man is an exception, whatever else he is. If he is not the image of God, then he is a disease of the dust. If it is not true that a divine being fell, then we can only say that one of the animals went entirely off his head."&mdash;G.K. Chesterton: *All Things Considered*

## Saving Humanity
Sat, 29 Jun 2019

&ldquo;The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false-face for the urge to rule it. Power is what all messiahs really seek: not the chance to serve. This is true even of the pious brethren who carry the gospel to foreign parts.&rdquo;&mdash;H.L. Mencken

## Respect
Sat, 29 Jun 2019

&ldquo;Respect, I note, was once conferred upon the dutiful. It was not until recently that a “theory” was hatched — a bastardization of ancient Christian teaching — that compelled us to show respect to all, and civility even to the uncivil. This was an important abridgement of our freedom: to decide, for ourselves, whom to love, admire, ignore, fear, detest, &c. It interferes with our duty to make sound judgements, thus dehumanizing us.&rdquo;&mdash;[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/06/26/aside-on-law-order/)

## Barlow&rsquo;s 25
Mon, 1 Jul 2019

John Perry Barlow's 25 Principles of Adult Behavior:

1. Be patient. No matter what.

2. Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to him.

3. Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.

4. Expand your sense of the possible.

5. Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.

6. Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.

7. Tolerate ambiguity.

8. Laugh at yourself frequently.

9. Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.

10. Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.

11. Give up blood sports.

12. Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don’t risk it frivolously.

13. Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)

14. Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.

15. Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.

16. Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.

17. Praise at least as often as you disparage.

18. Admit your errors freely and soon.

19. Become less suspicious of joy.

20. Understand humility.

21. Remember that love forgives everything.

22. Foster dignity.

23. Live memorably.

24. Love yourself.

25. Endure.

## Analog Future
Mon, 1 Jul 2019

&ldquo;Nature uses digital coding for the storage, replication, recombination, and error correction of sequences of nucleotides, but relies on analog coding and analog computing for intelligence and control. No programming, no code. To those seeking true intelligence, autonomy, and control among machines, the domain of analog computing, not digital computing, is the place to look.&rdquo;&mdash;[George Dyson](https://www.edge.org/conversation/george_dyson-childhoods-end)

## Potatoes
Tue, 2 Jul 2019

&ldquo;What is this mind of ours; what are these atoms with consciousness? Last week&rsquo;s potatoes!&rdquo;&mdash;Richard Feynman

Assuming, of course that there is a one-to-one exclusive relationship between mind/consciousness and brain, which seems to me to be extremely complex. There's clearly a relationship, but is it exclusive? Without a brain&mdash;divorced from living matter&mdash;is there some element of mind or even consciousness? Soul? Spirit? Arr, that's the question! Or perhaps a step on the way to the question...

## True to its telling

&ldquo;Of course there was more. If you ask the right questions, there always is.

That&rsquo;s the problem.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert Caro, *Working*

## The Relation of Christians to the World
Sat, 6 Jul 2019

&ldquo;To sum up all in one word--what the soul is in the body, that are Christians in the world. The soul is dispersed through all the members of the body, and Christians are scattered through all the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, yet is not of the body; and Christians dwell in the world, yet are not of the world. The invisible soul is guarded by the visible body, and Christians are known indeed to be in the world, but their godliness remains invisible. The flesh hates the soul, and wars against it, though itself suffering no injury, because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also hates the Christians, though in nowise injured, because they abjure pleasures. The soul loves the flesh that hates it, and [loves also] the members; Christians likewise love those that hate them. The soul is imprisoned in the body, yet preserves that very body; and Christians are confined in the world as in a prison, and yet they are the preservers of the world. The immortal soul dwells in a mortal tabernacle; and Christians dwell as sojourners in corruptible [bodies], looking for an incorruptible dwelling in the heavens. The soul, when but ill-provided with food and drink, becomes better; in like manner, the Christians, though subjected day by day to punishment, increase the more in number. God has assigned them this illustrious position, which it were unlawful for them to forsake.&rdquo;&mdash;Diagnetus, *[The Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/diognetus-roberts.html)*

## Cognitive Liberty
Mon, 8 Jul 2019

The aim of the chapter is to draw attention to a fundamental right that is neglected in the law but that is highly relevant for neuroethics: cognitive liberty or freedom of thought. Although an internationally accepted human right, it has not gained practical legal importance. However, any regulation of neurotechnologies has to be evaluated in its light. As the right is unfamiliar to policy makers and even to many lawyers and legal scholars, its historical development and the main arguments for its recognition are sketched. Furthermore, some suggestions for its interpretation, scope, and contours are forwarded and remaining open questions identified. According to international human rights law, the right is of absolute nature so that interferences cannot be justified for interests of the common good or paternalistic reasons. Whether this strict prohibition of intervening into other persons’ minds can and should be sustained even in light of putative pressing public interests and various neuroethical considerations is one of the novel questions neuroscience poses for the law.&mdash;Christoph Bublitz, Faculty of Law, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany *[Cognitive Liberty or the International Human Right to Freedom of Thought](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-4707-4_166)*

## Cognitive Liberty Redux
Mon, 8 Jul 2019

“Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind.” (Milton, *Comus*)

“Everyone has the right to freedom to hold opinions without interference.” (United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights)

“Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth &mdash more than ruin &mdash; more even than death.... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.” (Bertrand Russell)

## Reading with a Pencil
Mon, 8 Jul 2019

&ldquo;The intellectual is, quite simply, a human being who has a pencil in his or her hand when reading a book.&rdquo;—George Steiner

&ldquo;There’s a way of reading that is like writing. You feel in collaboration… You have a pen in your hand, you’re going along in a way that’s, like, half creating it as you go. And you’re also strip-mining it for anything you can use… you’re sifting for what could be gold.&rdquo;—Patricia Lockwood

“Every piece of art I’ve ever made was because I saw bad and could do better, or saw great and needed to catch up.”&mdash;John T. Unger

“Full ownership of a book only comes when you have made it a part of yourself, and the best way to make yourself a part of it — which comes to the same thing — is by writing in it. Why is marking a book indispensable to reading it? First, it keeps you awake — not merely conscious, but wide awake. Second, reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends to express itself in words, spoken or written. The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks. Third, writing your reactions down helps you to remember the thoughts of the author. Reading a book should be a conversation between you and the author….Marking a book is literally an expression of your differences or your agreements…It is the highest respect you can pay him..”&mdash;Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren , *How To Read A Book*

## Indifferent
Tue, 9 Jul 2019

&ldquo;I don't know of any teaching more self-centered and further from the facts than Marxism. Ordinarily, people are anxious to test their theories in practice, to learn from experience. But those who wield power are so anxious to establish the myth of their own infallibility that they turn their backs on truth as  squarely as they can. Politics mean nothing to me. I don't like people who are indifferent to the truth.&rdquo;&mdash;Boris Pasternak, *Doctor Zhivago*

## Printing
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

"Printing diffused true knowledge, but it also diffused (and on a far greater scale) false knowledge and unproved irrational affirmation."&mdash;Hilaire Belloc, *The Crisis of Our Civilization*

## Persecution
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

"But if I be asked what sign we may look for to show that the advance of the Faith is at hand, I would answer by a word the modern world has forgotten: Persecution. When that shall be at work it will be morning."—Hilaire Belloc, *Survivals and New Arrivals*

## Petty Alienation
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

“Free-floating, petty gripes are a result of Miserabilism as a world view, the idea that viewing Western Civ as a hellish, gruesome burden destined to collapse of its sins and conceits is the only possible worldview for a Serious Person. Hence the more fault you find, the deeper you are. It comes from being grounded in nothing but the shallow soil of the present, with no sense of history except for a series of pre-approved narratives intended to culminate in an argument against the recent past, which was bad because it prevented the wonderful possible Tomorrow from happening Today. It’s a recipe for life-long alienation.”&mdash;[James Lileks](http://lileks.com/bleats/archive/19/0719/070919.html)

##  Making Money vs Spending Money
Wed, 10 Jul 2019

“Big money isn’t hard to come by. All it costs is a lifetime of devotion. But no ballerina ever works harder. Captain, that’s not your style; you don’t want to make money, you simply want to spend money.”

“Correct, sir! So I can’t see why you would want to take Mike’s wealth away from him.” “Because great wealth is a curse—unless you enjoy money-making for its own sake. Even then it has serious drawbacks.”

“Oh, piffle! Jubal, you talk like a harem guard trying to sell a whole man on the advantages of being a eunuch.”

“Possibly,” agreed Jubal. “The mind’s ability to rationalize its own shortcomings is unlimited; I am no exception. Since I, like yourself, sir, have no interest in money other than to spend it, it is impossible for me to get rich. Conversely, there has never been any danger that I would fail to scrounge the modest amount needed to feed my vices, since anyone with the savvy not to draw to a small pair can do that. But great wealth?....Captain, you don’t know what an Old Man of the Sea great wealth is. Its owner is beset on every side, like beggars in Bombay, each demanding that he invest or give away part of his wealth. He becomes suspicious—honest friendship is rarely offered him; those who could have been friends are too fastidious to be jostled by beggars, too proud to risk being mistaken for one.

“Worse yet, his family is always in danger. Captain, have your daughters ever been threatened with kidnapping?”

“What? Good Lord, no!”

“If you possessed the wealth Mike had thrust on him, you would have those girls guarded night and day—still you would not rest, because you would never be sure of the guards. Look at the last hundred or so kidnappings and note how many involved a trusted employee . . . and how few victims escaped alive. Is there anything money can buy which is worth having your daughters’ necks in a noose?”

Van Tromp looked thoughtful. “I’ll keep my mortgaged house, Jubal.”

“Amen. I want to live my own life, sleep in my own bed—and not be bothered!”&mdash;Robert A. Heinlein, *Stranger in a Strange Land*

## Names
Fri, 12 Jul 2019

“The sage Confucius was once asked what he would do if he was a governor. He said he would “rectify the names” to make words correspond to reality. He understood what General Semantics teaches; if your linguistic map is sufficiently confused, you will misunderstand the territory. And be readily outmaneuvered by those who are less confused.”&mdash;[Eric S. Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8415)

esr goes on to make interesting and important comments about the currently hot Richard Epstein scandal and its larger context, seriously worth reading and thinking about.

I'm posting it here, however, to note the map/territory statement, which Gregory Bateson speaks about at length in *Steps to an Ecology of Mind* (1972) and/or *Mind and Nature* (1979), Bateson being an “English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist” per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson) and a founding participant, with his wife Margaret Mead, in the Macy Conferences. Stewart Brand introduced me to his work via the WEC, and it's been at least somewhat influential in my muddled thinking.

And now, the question is how does this form of General Semantics fit in with (or survive?) Barfield's philological analysis of how consciousness evolved and relates to the “unrepresented” as well as the “appearances”.

## God the Father
Fri, 12 Jul 2019

“GOD is therefore truly the Father, inasmuch as He is Father of truth; He does not create the Son from outside Himself, but generates Him from His own substance. That is to say, being wise, He generates Wisdom, being just, Justice, be eternal, the Eternal, being immortal, the Immortal, being invisible, the Invisible. Because He is Light, He generates Brightness, and because He is Mind, the Word.”—Rufinus: Commentary on the Apostles’ Creed, 4. (5th cent.)

## Principles and Edge Cases
Sat, 13 Jul 2019

Principles that we suspend during difficult times aren’t really principles. Principles really count when they’re difficult to maintain.

That’s not the same thing, though, as refusing to consider the edge cases.

“Free speech,” is a fine principle, one to live by. But shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theater isn’t allowed, for good reason.

The edge cases are always subject to endless debate. There are no easy bright lines. It’s tempting, then, to never consider the edge cases. A rule’s a rule.

But principles without judgment aren’t the easy path they seem to be. Because without our judgment on the edge cases, we’ve given up responsibility. It’s no longer our decision if we’re not making a decision.

The hard work involves willingly being on the hook for making a tough call.

## Clowns
Sun, 14 Jul 2019

Isn't it rich?<br/>
Are we a pair?<br/>
Me here at last on the ground,</br>
You in mid-air.<br/>
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?</br>
Don't you approve?</br>
One who keeps tearing around,</br>
One who can't move...</br>
Where are the clowns?</br>
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped opening doors,</br>
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.</br>
Making my entrance again with my usual flair</br>
Sure of my lines...</br>
No one is there.

Don't you love farce?</br>
My fault, I fear.</br>
I thought that you'd want what I want...</br>
Sorry, my dear!</br>
But where are the clowns</br>
Send in the clowns</br>
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?</br>
Isn't it queer?</br>
Losing my timing this late in my career.</br>
But where are the clowns?</br>
There ought to be clowns...</br>
Well, maybe next year.

Stephen Sondheim, *A Little Night Music* 1973

## Folly of Fools
Thu, 18 Jul 2019

“Lying can be cognitively demanding. You must suppress the truth and construct a falsehood that is plausible on its face and does not contradict anything known by the listener, nor likely to be known. You must tell it in a convincing way and you must remember the story. This usually takes time and concentration, both of which may give off secondary cues and reduce performance on simultaneous tasks.”—Robert Trivers, *The Folly of Fools*

## Three Rules to Live By
Thu, 25 Jul 2019

“Three rules [Lou Reed] and I came up with – rules to live by. The first one is don’t be afraid of anyone. Imagine living your life so that you are afraid of no one. Second is get a really good bullshit detector and learn how to use it. And third is be really, really tender.”—Laurie Anderson

## Stranger Things
Fri, 26 Jul 2019

W -I went outside and it was worse.

Dr - How was it worse.

W - There was this storm.

Dr - so, how did you feel when you saw the storm?

W - I felt frozen.

Dr - Heartbreaking?

W - Frozen.

Dr - Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?

W - No, like how you feel when you are scared and can’t  breath or talk or do anything. I felt like this evil, like it was looking at me.

Dr - This evil. Well, what do you think this evil wanted?

W - You.

Dr - You?

W - Not me, everyone.

## The Race
Sat, 27 Jul 2019

“In a society caught up in the race for the better, limits on change are experienced as a threat. The commitments to the better at any cost makes the good impossible at all costs. Failure to renew the bill of goods frustrates the expectation of what is possible, while renewal of the bill of goods intensifies the expectations of unattainable progress. What people have and what they are about to get are equally exasperating to them. Accelerating change has become both addictive and intolerable. At this point the balance among stability, change and tradition has been upset; society has lost both its roots in shared memories and its bearings for innovation. Judgement on precedents has lost its value.”— Ivan Illich, *Tools for Conviviality*

## Compassion
Sun, 04 Aug 2019

"‘Need’ now means wanting someone else’s money. ‘Greed’ means wanting to keep your own. 'Compassion’ is when a politician arranges the transfer."—Joseph Sobran

## Science
Mon, 05 Aug 2019

“Our modern conception of science is a bureaucratic mechanism called ‘scientific method’ which denies the existence of human intuition, and thus our humanity. It is never actually followed—no scientist ever discovered anything in a time-serving, methodical way; especially not on billion-dollar machines. But still we praise and believe in this method, or such derivatives as Popper’s ‘falsifiability,’ because we are easily pleased, profligate, and hopelessly glib.”—[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/08/05/a-call-to-revolt/)

See [Saving the Appearances](https://acmdas.github.io/appearances.html) Chapter IX.

## Science (again)
Tue, 06 Aug 2019

“A scientific discovery is very convincing, but at the same time scientific knowledge is never definitive and is always open to revision. This is a central point. Science establishes its credibility and its reliability through its refusal to be definitive and certain.”—Carlo Rovelli 

## Silence
Tue, 06 Aug 2019

“Silence must be excluded at all cost, since it awakens you to the emptiness that looms on the edge of modern life, threatening to confront you with the dreadful truth, that you have nothing whatever to say.”—Roger Scruton

“After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music.”—Aldous Huxley

## Maturin on Democracy
Wed, 07 Aug 2019

‘Jack,’ said Stephen, ‘I have been contemplating on your words about the nature of the majority, your strangely violent, radical, and even — forgive me — democratic words, which, with their treasonable implication of ‘one man, one vote’, might be interpreted as an attack on the sacred rights of property; and I should like to know how you reconcile them with your support of a Tory ministry in the House.’

‘Oh, as for that,’ said Jack, ‘I have no difficulty at all. It is entirely a matter of scale and circumstance. Everyone knows that on a large scale democracy is pernicious nonsense — a country or even a county cannot be run by a self-seeking parcel of tub-thumping politicians working on popular emotion, rousing the mob. Even at Brooks’s, which is a hotbed of democracy, the place is in fact run by the managers and those that don’t like it may either do the other thing or join Boodle’s; while as for a man-of-war, it is either an autocracy or it is nothing, nothing at all — mere nonsense. You saw what happened to the poor French navy at the beginning of the Revolutionary War…’

‘Dear Jack, I do not suppose literal democracy in a ship of the line nor even in a little small row-boat. I know too much of the sea,’ added Stephen, not without complacency.

‘…while at the other end of the scale, although ‘one man, one vote’ certainly smells of brimstone and the gallows, everyone has always accepted it in a jury trying a man for his life. An inclosure belongs to this scale: it too decides men’s lives. I had not realized how thoroughly it does so until I came back from sea and found that Griffiths and some of his friends had persuaded my father to join with them in inclosing Woolcombe Common…

‘Stephen, I do assure you. I was brought up rough when I was a little chap, after my mother’s death, sometimes at the village school, sometimes running wild; and I knew these men intimately as boys, and now to see them at the mercy of landlords, farmers, and God help us parish officers for poor relief, hurts me so that I can scarcely bring myself to go there again. And I am determined the same thing shall not happen to Simmon’s Lea, if ever I can prevent it. The old ways had disadvantages, of course, but here — and I speak only of what I know — it was a human life, and the people knew its ways and customs through and through.

—Patrick O’Brian, *The Yellow Admiral*

## Reality

“Those who seek the truth run the risk of finding it.”—Isabel Allende

## Choice
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

“We don't live our lives by choice, but by default. We play the roles we are born to. We don't live our lives, we dispose of them. We throw them away because we don't know any better. And the reason we don't know any better is because we never asked. We never questioned or doubted. Never stood up. Never drew a line. We never walked up to our parents or our spiritual advisers or our teachers or any of the other formative presences in our early lives and asked one simple. honest, straightforward question. The one question that must be answered before any other question can be asked:
“What the hell is going on here?”—Jed McKenna, *Spiritual Warfare*

## Cogito
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

“What do we know for sure? That's the real question. That's what the cogito is. That's what solipsism is. This isn't theory. This isn't belief or faith. This is the basic fact of existence. It's all about figuring out exactly what we know for certain as opposed to everything else. It's truly amazing that something so glaringly obvious and irrefutable is so universally ignored by science and philosophy and religion.”—Jed McKenna

## Words
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

“I am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behavior very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy.”—Dylan Thomas

## Uncomfortable
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

“Have an uncomfortable mind; be strange. Be disturbed: by what is happening on the planet, and to it; by the cruelty, and stupidity humanity is capable of; by the unbearable beauty of certain music, and the mysteries and failures of love, and the brief, confusing, exhilarating hour of your own life.”—Kim Addonizio, *Bukowski in a Sundress*

## Writing it Down
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

“The reason for writing it down on paper or on a computer where you can see it is because the brain, unlikely as it may sound, is no place for serious thinking. Any time you have serious thinking to do, the first step is to get the whole shootin' match out of your head and set it up someplace where you can walk around it and see it from all sides. Attack, switch sides and counter-attack. You can't do that while it's still in your head. Writing it out allows you to act as your own teacher, your own critic, your own opponent. By externalizing your thoughts, you can become your own guru; judging yourself, giving feedback, providing a more objective and elevated perspective.”—Jed McKenna, *Spiritual Enlightenment: The Damnedest Thing*

## Mice
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

“Close your eyes and get quiet for a minute, until the chatter starts up. Then isolate one of the voices and imagine the person speaking as a mouse. Pick it up by the tail and drop it into a mason jar. Then isolate another voice, pick it up by the tail, drop it in the jar. And so on. Drop in any high-maintenance parental units, drop in any contractors, lawyers, colleagues, children, anyone who is whining in your head. Then put the lid on, and watch all these mouse people clawing at the glass, jabbering away, trying to make you feel like shit because you won't do what they want - won't give them more money, won't be more successful, won't see them more often. Then imagine that there is a volume-control button on the bottle. Turn it all the way up for a minute, and listen to the stream of angry, neglected, guilt-mongering voices. Then turn it all the way down and watch the frantic mice lunge at the glass, trying to get to you. Leave it down, and get back to your shitty first draft. A writer friend of mine suggests opening the jar and shooting them all in the head. But I think he's a little angry, and I'm sure nothing like this would ever occur to you.”—Anne Lamott, *Bird by Bird*, p. 27

## Dealing Words
Sun, 18 Aug 2019

“I am, by calling, a dealer in words; and words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind. Not only do words infect, ergotise, narcotise, and paralyse, but they enter into and colour the minutest cells of the brain, very much as madder mixed with a stag's food at the Zoo colours the growth of the animal's antlers. Moreover, in the case of the human animal, that acquired tint, or taint, is transmissible. May I give you an instance? There is a legend which has been transmitted to us from the remotest ages. It has entered into many brains and coloured not a few creeds. It is this: Once upon a time, or rather, at the very birth of Time, when the Gods were so new that they had no names, and Man was still damp from the clay of the pit whence he had been digged, Man claimed that he, too, was in some sort a deity. The Gods were as just in those days as they are now. They weighed his evidence and decided that Man’s claim was good - that he was, in effect, a divinity, and, as such, entitled to be freed from the trammels of mere brute instinct, and to enjoy the consequence of his own acts. But the Gods sell everything at a price. Having conceded Man's claim, the legend goes that they came by stealth and stole away this godhead, with intent to hide it where Man should never find it again. But that was none so easy. If they hid it anywhere on Earth, the Gods foresaw that Man, the inveterate hunter - the father, you might say, of all hunters - would leave no stone unturned nor wave unplumbed till he had recovered it. If they concealed it among themselves, they feared that Man might in the end batter his way up even to the skies. And, while they were all thus at a stand, the wisest of the Gods, who afterwards became the God Brahm, said, "I know. Give it to me!" And he closed his hand upon the tiny unstable light of Man's stolen godhead, and when that great Hand opened again, the light was gone. "All is well," said Brahm. "I have hidden it where Man will never dream of looking for it. I have hidden it inside Man himself." "Yes, but whereabouts inside Man have you hidden it?" all the other Gods asked. "Ah," said Brahm, that is my secret, and always will be; unless and until Man discovers it for himself.”—Rudyard Kipling, *Surgeons and the Soul, A Book of Words*

## Science Explains
Sun, 18 Aug 2019

“The widespread cultural notion that science has explained most of the world is scandalously unjustified. For all we know, we've explained only very, very little; practically nothing. We just don't know what kinds of fundamental causal forces and organizing principles may kick in when systems become complex enough to be seen with the naked eye outside a laboratory. Inability to acknowledge this represents a catastrophic failure of skepticism.”—Bernardo Kastrup, *Brief Peeks Beyond*

## Tolerance
Sun, 25 Aug 2019

“Tolerance is creditable in our liberal ethos, and liberal sentimentality therefore guarantees a surfeit of false, affected and exaggerated tolerance. You can, in fact, be tolerant only under two very rigid conditions. You must disapprove of the behavior you tolerate, and you must have the power to stop it. If you do not disapprove of the behavior, you are indifferent, not tolerant. If you cannot stop it, you are merely resigned. Most of what passes for tolerance is actually indifference or resignation.”—[J. M. Smith](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/08/25/bloody-thoughts/)

## Indoctrinated
Tue, 27 Aug 2019

“Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this: ‘You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do. What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others, will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself—educating your own judgement. Those that stay must remember, always and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this particular society.’”—Doris Lessing, *The Golden Notebook*, p. 16

## In the End

“And, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.”—Paul McCartney

## Politics or Governance?
Thu, 29 Aug 2019

“’It’s just politics.’

“No one ever says, ‘it’s just governance.’

“Politics is organized sparring about power, without much regard for efficacy or right or wrong.

“Governance is the serious business of taking responsibility for leadership.

“Over the last twenty years, the mass media has shifted, from “here’s the news,” to, “hey, it’s just media.” As a result, a system has been built in which situations, emergencies and bad news have been packaged and promoted twenty-four hours a day.

“In the face of that maelstrom of noise, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that the world is more dangerous and unstable than it has ever been.

“When we have a chance to speak up for governance, we can strike a blow against politics.

“Because even though it doesn’t make compelling TV, the long-term challenges ahead of us aren’t going to respond to politics.

“Dedication, resilience and concerted effort have saved us before and they can save us again. Except once again, it’s on us to speak up and do something about it.”—[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2019/08/politics-vs-governance/)

## In His Image
Thu, 29 Aug 2019

“Contemporary man ... attempts to create the world in his image, to build a totally man-made environment, and then discovers that he can do so only on the condition of constantly remaking himself to fit it.”—Ivan Illich, *Tools for Conviviality*

## Truth
Fri, 30 Aug 2019

“A writer who says that there are no truths, or that all truth is ‘merely relative,’ is asking you not to believe him. So don’t.”—Roger Scruton

## Undeservedly
Fri, 30 Aug 2019

“Some books are undeservedly forgotten; none is undeservedly remembered”—W.H. Auden

## Virtues
Sat, 31 Aug 2019

“The modern world is not evil; in some ways the modern world is far too good. It is full of wild and wasted virtues. When a religious scheme is shattered…it is not merely the vices that are let loose. The vices are, indeed, let loose, and they wander and do damage. But the virtues are let loose also; and the virtues wander more wildly, and the virtues do more terrible damage. The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone. Thus some scientists care for truth; and their truth is pitiless. Thus some humanitarians only care for pity; and their pity (I am sorry to say) is often untruthful.”—G. K. Chesterton, *Orthodoxy*

## Quotes

## Seeing
Sun, 01 Sep 2019
“Things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the arts that have influenced us.

“To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing. One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.”—Oscan Wilde, *from his commonplace book*

## Wait

## Failure

“If at first you don’t succeed, failure may be your style.”—Quentin Crisp

## Inward
Tue, 03 Sep 2019

“Neither look forward where there is doubt nor backward where there is regret. Look inward and ask not if there is anything outside you want, but whether there is anything inside that you have not yet unpacked.”—Quentin Crisp

## Reality
Wed, 04 Sep 2019

“Everyone has their own reality in which, if one is not too cautious, timid, or frightened, one swims. This is the only reality there is. If you can get it down on paper, in words, notes, or color, so much the better. The great artists don't even bother to put it down on paper: they live with it silently, they become it.”—Henry Miller, *Stand Still Like The Hummingbird*

## Possibilities
Wed, 04 Sep 2019

“It’s like everything in life right now; it has to do with being in the right place at the right time. The universe will bring you an abundance of opportunities and possibilities. It’s really all about trusting that before you got there, when you were sleeping, the universe was conspiring to give you something to blow your mind. Would you be open to receive it?”—Carlos Santana, *interview, AARP Magazine August/September issue*

## Three Things
Mon, 09 Sep 2019

“To this day he (Carlos Santana) still sends me texts to remind me that the only three things I can control are my motive, intention and purpose. And to always remember to do what I do with gratitude. I’m not the vessel; I’m the passenger. But sometimes I can be the engine.”—Rob Thomas

## Experiment
Wed, 11 Sep 2019

“I believe that this crisis is rooted in a major twofold experiment which has failed, and I claim that the resolution of the crisis begins with a recognition of the failure. For a hundred years we have tried to make machines work for men and to school men for life in their service. Now it turns out that machines do not 'work' and that people cannot be schooled for a life at the service of machines. The hypothesis on which the experiment was built must now be discarded. The hypothesis was that machines can replace slaves. The evidence shows that, used for this purpose, machines enslave men.”—Ivan Illich, *Tools for Conviviality*

## Facts
Wed, 11 Sep 2019

“Our civil institutions were founded upon an assumption that people would be able to agree on what reality is, agree on facts, and that they would then make rational, good-faith decisions based on that. They might disagree as to how to interpret those facts or what their political philosophy was, but it was all founded on a shared understanding of reality.

And that’s now been dissolved out from under us, and we don’t have a mechanism to address that problem.”—Neil Stephenson, in a [”podcast” with Tyler Cowen](https://cowenconvos.libsyn.com/neal-stephenson)

## Words
Thu, 12 Sep 2019

“Words tend to last a bit longer than things, but eventually they fade too, along with the pictures they once evoked. Entire categories of objects disappear - flowerpots, for example, or cigarette filters, or rubber bands - and for a time you will be able to recognize those words, even if you cannot recall what they mean. But then, little by little, the words become only sounds, a random collection of glottals and fricatives, a storm of whirling phonemes, and finally the whole thing just collapses into gibberish.”—Paul Auster, *Country of Last Things*

## The Myth of Modernity
Thu, 12 Sep 2019

“The new world picture, as it turned out, consciously and unconsciously drew on the machine as an organizing principle. The answer to the cultural upheavals, then, was to build institutions that would generate consensus not through the arduous work of contesting and resolving differences, but by automating the public realm and cultivating subjects qua citizens that would be willing to buy into the validity of ‘objective facts,’ neutral institutions, etc. 

“In short, modernity was built upon a myth:  the myth of neutrality or objectivity—neutral facts, neutral procedures, neutral institutions, neutral technology. It was this myth, wielded as a weapon against all manner of superstitions, that sustained the ideals of ‘Reason,’ ‘Progress,’ the ‘Rational Actor,’ etc. Reader: It, too, was a superstition.“—[L. M. Sacasas](https://tinyletter.com/lmsacasas/letters/the-convivial-society-no-22)

## Inevitability

“There is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening.”—Marshall McLuhan

## Forgiveness

“People cannot forgive what they cannot punish.”—Hannah Arendt

## A Prayer
Fri, 13 Sep 2019

“O GOD, the protector of all that trust in thee, without whom nothing is strong, nothing is holy: Increase and multiply upon us thy mercy; that, thou being our ruler and guide, we may so pass through things temporal, that we finally lose not the things eternal: Grant this, O heavenly Father, for Jesus Christ’s sake our Lord. Amen.”—*Book of Common Prayer*, quoted by C.S. Lewis in his essay, “A Slip of the Tongue”, 1956 in *The Weight of Glory*

## Appearance and Reality
Mon, 16 Sep 2019

“Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy﻿—for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.

“In daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see out of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth’s rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.”—Bertrand Russell, *The Problems of Philosophy*, 1912

## Not the Answer
Wed, 18 Sep 2019

“Why is it so easy for people to reject Christianity? When by contrast the same people will be prepared to put immense time and effort into (for example) trying to rehabilitate some version of Leftist politics as a possible answer; or paganism, Hinduism or Buddhism as a possible answer?”—[Bruce Charlton](https://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/09/why-have-so-many-people-over-past-two.html)

## The Cure for Consumerism
Tue, 24 Sep 2019

“One of the consumer’s little-known rights is, not to buy stuff. This is easier than may appear. He (or even she) may be, in some sense, suffering from an addiction. But I’ve been told by the experts, this can be overcome. Take up reading, instead. Whenever the urge to shop afflicts you, open a book. Make a pot of tea, and relax somewhere. Think about things.

In Canada, today, you are even allowed to think officially disapproved thoughts, so long as you don’t tell anyone what they were.”—[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/09/24/the-cure-for-consumerism/)

## Julian
Sun, 29 Sep 2019

“But our Lord said to me, ‘I am the ground of thy beseechings: first, it is My will that thou have it; and then I make thee to wish for it; and then I make thee to beseech it, and thou beseechest it. How then should it be that thou shouldest not have thy beseeching?’

“For it is most impossible that we should beseech mercy and grace and not have it. For all things that our good Lord maketh us to beseech, Himself hath ordained them to us from without beginning. Here may we see that our beseeching is not the cause of God’s goodness; and that showed He soothfastly in all these sweet words which He saith: ‘I am the ground.’ And our good Lord willeth that this be known of His lovers in earth; and the more that we know it the more should we beseech, if it be wisely taken; and so is our Lord's meaning. Merry and joyous is our Lord of our prayer, and He looketh for it; and He willeth to have it; because with His grace He would have us like to Himself in condition as we are in kind. Therefore saith He to us ‘Pray inwardly, although thou think it has no savour to thee: for it is profitable, though thou feel not, though thou see not, yea, though thou think thou canst not.’”—Julian of Norwich

From a note that I wrote to myself, 12 March, 2012.

## Aidos
Tue, 01 Oct 2019

“Aidos (Greek: Αἰδώς, pronounced [ai̯dɔ̌ːs]) was the Greek goddess of shame, modesty, respect, and humility. Aidos, as a quality, was that feeling of reverence or shame which restrains men from wrong. It also encompassed the emotion that a rich person might feel in the presence of the impoverished, that their disparity of wealth, whether a matter of luck or merit, was ultimately undeserved. Ancient and Christian humility have some common points, they are both the rejection of egotism and self-centeredness, arrogance and excessive pride, and is an recognition of human limitations. Aristotle defined it as a middle ground between vanity and cowardice.”–Wikipedia entry

From a note in my notepad from sometime in March, 2019—”Greek ‘Aidos’ “Walk humbly to appease the Fates.”

## The Sin Is
Wed, 02 Oct 2019

“The sin is the lie, or intent to mislead - unaffected by the justification that it was just about a small matter...

“The sin is the spite: the wanting to harm another for one's own gratification - not in the magnitude of that which is wished upon them.

“The sin is in the resentment - it does not matter whether criticism is 'deserved'.

“Evil is in the believed and argued inversion of virtue - not in whatever harmful consequences of this inversion.”—Bruce Charlton

## Stupidity
Saturday, 05 Oct 2019

“Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenceless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgement simply need not be believed—in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical—and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid person than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.”—Dietrich Bonhoeffer

## Propaganda
Monday, 07 Oct 2019

“Those who read the press of their group and listen to the radio of their group are constantly reinforced in their allegiance. They learn more and more that their group is right, that its actions are justified; thus their beliefs are strengthened. At the same time, such propaganda contains elements of criticism and refutation of other groups, which will never be read or heard by a member of another group...Thus we see before our eyes how a world of closed minds establishes itself, a world in which everybody talks to himself, everybody constantly views his own certainty about himself and the wrongs done him by the Others—a world in which nobody listens to anybody else.”—Jacques Ellul, *Propaganda* (1973)

## Phrenology
Monday, 07 Oct 2019

“As many have noted, facial recognition in some circles amounts to data-driven phrenology. I'm sometimes inclined to think that we are doomed to repeat the worst errors of the past but in a digitally augmented fashion. Often this is connected with a characteristically modern desire or urge to achieve a God's-eye-view of things without, you know, God. Much of what we might now think of as traditional postmodernism—thirty years ago I suspect no one would have imagined speaking of traditional postmodernism, but there it is and I think it works—was basically an acknowledgement that the modern quest for certain, objective, universal Truth had exhausted itself. Digital technology has re-animated the corpse, which is why we now see zombie versions of phrenology, eugenics, and the like floating around.”—[L.M.

## After an Age has Ended
Monday, 07 Oct 2019

"What does a man do when he finds himself living after an age has ended and he can no longer understand himself because the theories of man of the former age no longer work and the theories of the new age are not yet known, for not even the name of the new age is known, and so everything is upside down, people feeling bad when they should feel good, good when they should feel bad? … What is he then? He has not the faintest idea. Entered as he is into a new age, he is like a child who sees everything in his new world, names everything, knows everything except himself.”—Walker Percy, “The Delta Factor” in *The Message in the Bottle*

## Repetition
Monday, 07 Oct 2019

“Recollection is a discarded garment that does not fit, however beautiful it is, for one has outgrown it. Repetition is an indestructible garment that fits closely and tenderly, neither binds nor sags… recollection is a beautiful old woman with whom one is never satisfied at the moment; repetition is a beloved wife of whom one never wearies, for one becomes weary only of what is new.”–Søren Kierkegaard, *Repetition*

## Taboos
Saturday, 12 Oct 2019

“I suspect the biggest source of moral taboos will turn out to be power struggles in which one side only barely has the upper hand. That's where you'll find a group powerful enough to enforce taboos, but weak enough to need them.

“Most struggles, whatever they're really about, will be cast as struggles between competing ideas. The English Reformation was at bottom a struggle for wealth and power, but it ended up being cast as a struggle to preserve the souls of Englishmen from the corrupting influence of Rome. It's easier to get people to fight for an idea. And whichever side wins, their ideas will also be considered to have triumphed, as if God wanted to signal his agreement by selecting that side as the victor.

“We often like to think of World War II as a triumph of freedom over totalitarianism. We conveniently forget that the Soviet Union was also one of the winners.”—[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html)

From Graham’s 2004 essay, “What You Can’t Say”. Only more pertinent fifteen years later. RTWT.

## Poetry
Saturday, 12 Oct 2019

“And then a man of forty or so, with a French accent, asked, ‘How do you achieve the presence of mind to initiate the writing of a poem?’ And something cracked open in me, and I finally stopped hoarding and told them my most useful secret. The only secret that has helped me consistently over all the years that I've written. I said, ‘Well, I’ll tell you how. I ask a simple question. I ask myself: What was the very best moment of your day?’ The wonder of it was, I told them, that this one question could lift out from my life exactly what I will want to write a poem about. Something I hadn’t known was important will leap out and hover there in front of me, saying I am—I am the best moment of the day. ‘Often,’ I went on, ‘it’s a moment when you're waiting for someone, or you're driving somewhere, or maybe you're just walking across a parking lot and admiring the oil stains and the dribbled tar patterns. One time it was when I was driving past a certain house that was screaming with sunlitness on its white clapboards, and then I plunged through tree shadows that splashed and splayed across the windshield. I thought, Ah, of course—I'd forgotten. You, windshield shadows, you are the best moment of the day.’”—Nicholson Baker, *The Anthologist*

## Primary Business
Wednesday, 16 Oct 2019

“For if I believe anything, it is that the primary business of literature and art is cognitive, a kind of finding out and knowing and telling, both in good times and bad; a celebration of the way things are when they are right, and a diagnostic enterprise when they are wrong.”—Walker Percy

## Transmission
Wednesday, 16 Oct 2019

“My theory is that the purpose of art is to transmit universal truths of a sort, but of a particular sort, that in art, whether it’s poetry, fiction or painting, you are telling the reader or listener or viewer something he already knows but which he doesn’t quite know that he knows, so that in the action of communication he experiences a recognition, a feeling that he has been there before, a shock of recognition. And so, what the artist does, or tries to do, is simply to validate the human experience and to tell people the deep human truths which they already unconsciously know.”—Walker Percy

## Blockhead
Sunday, 20 Oct 2019

“The friendship of a blockhead shun,<br/>Said Israel’s monarch, David’s son.”—Samuel Low, *The Fool’s Friendship* (c. 1800)

“And all that pity you are made your prey.”—Thomas Otway, *The Orphan* (1680)

“Unlike Nietzsche, I accept pity (compassion) as a virtue, but unlike many modern Christians, I see pity as a secondary virtue that degenerates into pathological altruism when it is not regulated by the primary virtues of justice, prudence and courage.  A man without compassion is certainly a bad man, but a man who is guided by nothing but compassion is a King Midas of misery.  Everything he touches turns to mold.”—[J.M. Smith](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/morbid-pity-and-the-apotheosis-of-blockheads/)

## Veterinary Politics
Tuesday, 29 Oct 2019

“About 25 years ago I was active in university politics, nationally and locally; and after several experiences I realised that we were in an era in which the leadership were not bound by words.

“They would say anything that was currently expedient, but it meant nothing. In particular promises, resolutions and commitments meant precisely nothing.

“I began to adopt a veterinary attitude. The term comes from my training in medicine. When patients are unable to talk (e.g. children) or unreliable ‘historians’ of their symptoms (e.g psychosis or dementia) then we practiced veterinary medicine, like a vet, based purely on our own observations.

“So it is a long time since I took notice of what chief executives, politicians, bishops or any kind of bureaucrat has to say. I don’t believe what they claim they are doing or have done. I wait to see what I observe for myself.

“Brexit has led to an unprecedented concentration and sustained output of empty speech, and this continues. I do not believe any of it. I will not believe it even if They say we have ‘now’ left the EU. I will wait to see if I can observe it myself in my own life or immediate circle of trusted and competent persons.

“Veterinary politics has advantages! It frees up a lot of time and energy for other and more fundamental activities, including the most important of all.”—Dr. Bruce Charlton

## Necessity of Non-Education
Tuesday, 29 Oct 2019

“Because a knowledge of letters is entirely indispensable to a country, it is certain that they should not be indiscriminately taught to everyone. A body which had eyes all over it would be monstrous, and in like fashion so would a state if all its subjects were learned; one would find little obedience and an excess of pride and presumption.

“The commerce of letters would drive out that of goods, from which the wealth of the state is derived. It would ruin agriculture, the true nourishment of the people, and in time would dry up the source of soldiery, whose ranks flow more from the crudities of ignorance than from refinements of knowledge.

“It would, indeed, fill France with quibblers more suited to the ruination of good families and the upsetting of public order than to doing any good for the country.

“If learning were profaned by extending it to all kinds of people one would see far more men capable of raising doubts than of resolving them, and many would be better able to oppose truth than to defend it.

“It is for this reason that statesmen in a well-run country would wish to have as teachers more masters of mechanic arts than of liberal arts.”—*The Political Testament of Cardinal Richelieu*, chapter II (1642)

## Current News
Sunday, 03 Nov, 2019

“To the extent that propaganda is based on current news, it cannot permit time for thought or reflection. A man caught up in the news must remain on the surface of the events; he is carried along in the current, and can at no time take a respite to judge and appreciate; he can never stop to reflect ... One thought drives away another; old facts are chased by new ones. Under these conditions there can be no thought. And, in fact modern man does not think about current problems; he feels them. He reacts, but he does not understand them any more than he takes responsibility for them. He is even less capable of spotting any inconsistency between successive facts; man’s capacity to forget is unlimited ... This situation makes the ‘current-events man’ a ready target for propaganda.”—Jacques Ellul, *Propaganda* (1973)

## Owning
Sunday, 03 Nov, 2019

“Anyone claiming to know the future is really just trying to own it.”—[Margaret Heffernan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009522)

## The Liberal Outlook
Sunday, 03 Nov 2019

“Perhaps the essence of the Liberal outlook could be summed up in a new decalogue, not intended to replace the old one but only to supplement it. The Ten Commandments that, as a teacher, I should wish to promulgate, might be set forth as follows:

<ol>

<li>Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.</li>

<li>Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.</li>

<li>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.</li>

<li>When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavor to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.</li>

<li>Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.</li>

<li>Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.</li>

<li>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.</li>

<li>Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.</li>

<li>Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.</li>

<li>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.”</li>

</ol>

—Bertrand Russell, *The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell*

## What You Can’t Say
Sunday, 03 Nov 2019

“Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and been embarrassed at the way you looked? Did we actually dress like that? We did. And we had no idea how silly we looked. It’s the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all of us riding on it.

“What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They’re just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people. But they’re much more dangerous. Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good. Dressing oddly gets you laughed at. Violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed.

“If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing would be true no matter where you went: you’d have to watch what you said. Opinions we consider harmless could have gotten you in big trouble. I’ve already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century, and did get Galileo in big trouble when he said it—that the earth moves.”[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html) *January, 2004*

## Unique
Monday, 04 Nov 2019

“There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.”—Martha Graham

## Policy
Wednesday, 06 Nov 2019

“I love the sound policy makes when I break it.”

From a cartoon about kids being allowed to read “above their grade level.” I’ll find a link to it someday, maybe.

## The Essential Thing
Tuesday, 12 November 2019

“I must, before I die, find some way to say the essential thing that is in me, that I have never said yet—a thing that is not love or hate or pity or scorn, but the very breath of life, fierce and coming from far away, bringing into human life the vastness and the fearful passionless force of non-human things.”—Bertrand Russell

## At the Bottom
Tuesday, 12 November 2019

“There is something at the bottom of every new human thought, every thought of genius, or even every earnest thought that springs up in any brain, which can never be communicated to others, even if one were to write volumes about it and were explaining one's idea for thirty-five years; there's something left which cannot be induced to emerge from your brain, and remains with you forever; and with it you will die, without communicating to anyone perhaps the most important of your ideas.”—Fyodor Dostoevsky, *The Idiot*

## Allies and Accomplices
Thursday, 14 November 2019

“To be an ally means that you won’t get in the way, and, if you are able to, you’ll try to help.

“To become an accomplice, though, means that you’ve risked something, sacrificed something and put yourself on the hook as well.

“We need more allies, in all the work we do. Allies can open doors and help us feel a lot less alone.

“But finding an accomplice–that’s an extraordinary leap forward.

“Willie Jackson is leading that conversation in an area where we need it urgently: around race. Once you see it there, you’ll see it everywhere.

“When do we care enough to lean into the work, the mission or the problem? Even if we think it’s ‘someone else’s work.’ Because it probably belongs to us as well.”—Seth Godin

## Systems
Thursday, 14 November 2019

“Marriage and Family fundamentally are not systems - they precede all systems. Their basis is outwith all systems - because they are based on Love.

“Love is not abstract, nor is it the product of a model. Love is something real only between Beings; and Beings are not abstract, nor are they systems.

“(Indeed, any System could be described as an abstract model of a Being...)


“Marriage and family involve Beings (in reality, not in the system-induced subversions and distortions that we see in politics and law and the mass media - where they are reduced to abstract definitions). beings (such as you and me) are eternal entities; and Love - which is the primal relation, the primal cohesion, before system.

“When God created, it was Love that made possible creation - it is Love that distinguished creation from chaos. 

“So there is an alternative to The System - and it is based on Beings in Loving relationships.”—[Bruce Charlton](https://charltonteaching.blogspot.com/2019/11/what-we-are-supposed-to-learn-from.html)

## Lies
Thursday, 21 November, 2019

“If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer. This is because lies, by their very nature, have to be changed, and a lying government has constantly to rewrite its own history. On the receiving end you get not only one lie—a lie which you could go on for the rest of your days—but you get a great number of lies, depending on how the political wind blows. And a people that no longer can believe anything cannot make up its mind. It is deprived not only of its capacity to act but also of its capacity to think and to judge.”—Hannah Arendt


## Politics
Sunday, 24 November, 2019

“After 1789, politics ceased to be considered as the prudent management of men and circumstances, in order to become the ‘realization of ideas’. Political thinking became irredeemably ideological: an imposition of ideas on political life rather than an emergence of policy from living experience.”—Irving Kristol, *Yale Review* 1958

## Two Books
Sunday, 24 November, 2019

“Imagine that everyone in the older age brackets had to write two books—’Smart Things I Have Done in My Life’ and ‘Dumb Things I Have Done in My Life.’ Be frank. Which book do you think would be bigger? Even some of the smart things we did were a result of having done dumb things before and suffered the consequences.”—[Thomas Sowell](https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2004/12/06/random-thoughts-n996213)

## Facts are not interesting
Tuesday, 26 November, 2019

“I’m not interested in documenting. Documenting is extremely dull and I’m a very bad reporter. When I had an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946, my friend, Robert Capa, told me, “Henri, be very careful. You must not have a label of a surrealist photographer. If you do, you won’t have an assignment and you’ll be like a hothouse plant. Do whatever you like, but the label should be ‘photojournalist.’ ”

“All my training was surrealism. I still feel very close to the surrealists. But Capa was extremely sound. So I never mentioned surrealism. That’s my private affair. And what I want, what I’m looking for — that’s my business. Otherwise I never would have an assignment. Journalism is a way of noting — well, some journalists are wonderful writers and others are just putting facts one after the other. And facts are not interesting. It’s a point of view on facts which is important, and in photography it is the evocation. Some photographs are like a Chekhov short story or a Maupassant story. They’re quick things and there’s a whole world in them.”—Henri Cartier-Bresson, 1971 interview with Sheila Turner-Seed

## The Rage
Tuesday, 26 November, 2019

“He had the rage without the anger.”—John Mayer at Stevie Ray Vaughn’s induction into the R&R Hall of Fame

## Society as System
Wednesday, 27 November, 2019

“Existence in a society that has become a system finds the senses useless precisely because of the very instruments designed for their extension. One is prevented from touching and embracing reality. Further, one is programmed for interactive communication, one’s whole being is sucked into the system. It is this radical subversion of sensation that humiliates and then replaces perception.  We submit ourselves to fantastic degradations of image and sound consumption in order to anesthetize the pain resulting from having lost reality.”—Ivan Illich, "To Honor Jacques Ellul" (1993)

## The Optical Unconscious
Wednesday, 27 November, 2019

"With the close-up, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended. And just as enlargement not merely clarifies what we see indistinctly 'in any case,' but brings to light entirely new structures of matter, slow motion not only reveals familiar aspects of movements, but discloses quite unknown aspects within them ... Clearly, it is another nature which speaks to the camera as compared to the eye. 'Other' above all in the sense that a space informed by human consciousness gives way to a space informed by the unconscious ... It is through the camera that we first discover the optical unconscious."—Walter Benjamin, *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*

## Beginnings in History
Wednesday, 27 November, 2019

“An irony of studying history is that we often know exactly how a story ends, but have no idea where it began.”—[Morgan Housel](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/three-big-things-the-most-important-forces-shaping-the-world/)


Housel suggests that, if we work backwards from any issue at hand today, eventually we arrive at WWII—that the shift from 1939 to 1945 was fundamental. IMHO, that might be pushed back to 1914, but then we could push back to 1812, or 1789, or ...

For Housel the other Big Things today are demographics, inequality and access to information. I’d probably choose others that are equally “transformational and ubiquetous” but the basic thought is there...my old mantra, “There’s more to it than that.”

## Know Thy Self
Wednesday, 27 November, 2019

“All ages have said and repeated that one should strive to know one's self. This is a strange demand which no one up to now has measured up to and, strictly considered, no one should. With all their study and effort, people are directed to what is outside, to the world about them, and they are kept busy coming to know this and to master it to the extent that their purposes require. How can you come to know yourself? Never by thinking, always by doing. Try to do your duty, and you'll know right away what you amount to. And what is your duty? Whatever the day calls for.”—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

## Mysteries
Thursday, 28 November, 2019

“So: we come to rest with the mysteries... We do not abandon reason, we merely recognize its limitations. We reason to the existence of God, it is revealed to us that His Son was the incarnation, and that such was His love of us that He endured a torture excruciating in pain, and unique in aspect—the God of hosts, mutilated by His own creatures, whom He dies forgiving, loving. Can we do less? Yes, we do less, but must try to do more, until we die.”—William F. Buckley, Jr., *Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith*

## Self-destructing Paper
Thursday, 28 November, 2019

“The Internet is self destructing paper. A place where anything written is soon destroyed by rapacious competition and the only preservation is to forever copy writing from sheet to sheet faster than they can burn. If it’s worth writing, it’s worth keeping. If it can be kept, it might be worth writing…If you store your writing on a third party site like Blogger, Livejournal or even on your own site, but in the complex format used by blog/wiki software du jour you will lose it forever as soon as hypersonic wings of Internet labor flows direct people’s energies elsewhere. For most information published on the Internet, perhaps that is not a moment too soon, but how can the muse of originality soar when immolating transience brushes every feather?”—Julian Assange, [Self destructing paper](https://www.gwern.net/docs/technology/2007-assange-iq.org.html#Selfdestructingpaper), 5 December, 2006

## Special Knowledge
Thursday, 28 November, 2019

“Special knowledge can be a terrible disadvantage if it leads you too far along a path you cannot explain anymore.”—Brian Herbert, *Dune: House Harkonnen*

## The Feynman Method
Thursday, 28 November, 2019

“Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: *‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!’*”—[Gian-Carlo Rota](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html#feynmann)


## Be Prepared for Old Age
Thursday, 28 November, 2019

“My late friend Stan Ulam used to remark that his life was sharply divided into two halves. In the first half, he was always the youngest person in the group; in the second half, he was always the oldest. There was no transitional period.

“I now realize how right he was. The etiquette of old age does not seem to have been written up, and we have to learn it the hard way. It depends on a basic realization, which takes time to adjust to. You must realize that, after reaching a certain age, you are no longer viewed as a person. You become an institution, and you are treated the way institutions are treated. You are expected to behave like a piece of period furniture, an architectural landmark, or an incunabulum.

“It matters little whether you keep publishing or not. If your papers are no good, they will say, ‘What did you expect? He is a fixture!’ and if an occasional paper of yours is found to be interesting, they will say, ‘What did you expect? He has been working at this all his life!’ The only sensible response is to enjoy playing your newly-found role as an institution.”—[GianCarlo Rota](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html#old-age)

## Everyone and Noone Wants to Save the World
Saturday, 30 November, 2019

“When the world extended to one’s surrounding hills and mountains and over them was only legend, saving the world was approchable and a natural activity to all of independent character.

“You do not need to justify the possession of these noble instincts. Such attributes are normally distributed. You have a constellation of these attributes and that makes you who you are. Recognise that the substantial ones are invariant.

“You must satisfy your invariant instincts or you will be at odds with your own character. It is only when we are not at odds with our basic makeup that we can find life meaningful.

“To exercise your instinct for saving the world, requires saving what you perceive to be the world.

“Being modern, educated and wordly, the world you perceive is immense and this is disempowering compared to the valley world of your ancestors where your feelings were forged and where saving 10 people saved 10% of the “world”’s population.

“Here lays the difficulty in actualising your character. Your perception is of a world so vast that that you can not envisage your actions making a meaningful difference.

“People try to fool themselves and others into believing that one can “think globally and act locally”, however to anyone with a sense of proportion (not most people, btw) thinking globaly makes acting locally seem to be a marginal activity. It's not setting the world to rights.

“To meaningfully interact with the world, you have to either constrain your perception of what it is back to valley proportions by eschewing all global information (most of us here have engaged on just the opposite course which is what has provoked this discussion), losing your sense of perspective, or start seriously engaging with the modern perception of the world.

“That latter path can be hard to find, because it is only satisfied by creating ideas or inventions that have a global impact. Perhaps I have found one, and there's others out there, but for most people of your character a combination of eschewing knowledge of those parts of the world they can't change, and robust engagement with the parts they can is probably optimal.

“Do not be concerned about when one is to do good, who defines good, etc. Act in the way you do because to do otherwise would to be at odds would to be at odds with yourself. Being on a path true to your character carries with it a state of flow, where the thoughts about your next step come upon waking, unbidden, but welcome.

“I support similarly minded people, not because they are moral agents, but because they have common cause with my own feelings and dreams.”—[Julian Assange](https://web.archive.org/web/20071020051936/http://iq.org/#Everyoneandnoonewantstosavetheworld)

## Healthy Media Consumption
Monday, 02 December, 2019

  * I watch zero cable news.

  * I don’t read Twitter.

  * I use Facebook only to keep up with people who I care about personally. I tell myself to never, never comment on or share political posts on Facebook.

  * On my blog, I do not comment on any story I come across for at least 48 hours. Often, this means that I do not comment at all, because many stories do not stay in the news cycle more than two days. I almost never publish any post immediately. Instead, I schedule posts several days ahead. I am trying to make sure that I engage system 2 (sober and reflective) rather than system 1 (emotional and instinctive).

  * I try to give priority to long-form reading: books, essays, and journal articles. I also give priority to my own writing. Still, I need to get better about limiting the time that I spend on short-term reading.

  * I believe that it is a good idea to keep all devices in airplane mode for a 24-hour period once a week. I have difficulty executing this one, particularly when I travel.

  * I spend at least an hour a day doing physical activity (for me, it’s walking or biking or working out in the basement) accompanied by nothing but my thoughts and daydreams.

  * My sleep-time ritual is to curl up with a physical book or journal.

## Doodzwijgen
Tuesday, 03 December, 2019

“The Dutch language knows the priceless verb ‘doodzwijgen’, literally ‘kill something by keeping silent about it’. This has been a favorite tactic of European Brahmandarins for a long time—the near-media silence on the continuing Yellow Jackets protests is only the most recent example.”—[Nitay Arbel](https://accordingtohoyt.com/2019/10/08/brahmandarins-guest-post-by-nitay-arbel/)

## Humanism
Tuesday, 03 December, 2019

“When we say ‘Humanism’ today we are invariably talking blithering nonsense. The actual Humanist tradition was, like Erasmus himself, a mixed blessing, and finally a disaster. Our modern, atheist, ‘humanist’ creed is, by contrast, unmixed: a contumacious disaster from beginning to end. It carries none of the sincerity and well-intended zeal of the late mediaeval reformers, who were dedicated not to the overthrow of the Church, but to her renovation. They were more, not less, eager to enforce her morals, her faith, her splendour; to exalt her Christ. Only their vanity stood in their way.”—[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2019/12/03/remembering-humanism/)

## Ego/Self
Wednesday, 04 December, 2019

“The primary emotion that the ego lives by is fear.

“The primary emotion that the self lives by is love.

“What then, is Resistance?

“Resistance is the weapon the ego uses to prevent the individual from seating her identity in the Self.”—[Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/2019/12/ego-and-self-and-resistance/)

## A few ideas
Friday, 06 December 2019

“Everything rests on a few ideas that are fearsome and cannot be looked at directly.”—Paul Valery

## Made by Books
Saturday, 07 December 2019

“Oscar Wilde’s mot—that men are made by books rather than books by men—was certainly not pure nonsense; there is a very real sense, humiliating as it may seem, in which what we generally venture to call our feelings are really Shakespeare’s ‘meaning’.”—Owen Barfield, *Poetic Diction: a Study in Meaning*, (London: Faber & Gwyer, 1928. Third Edition. Middleton, CN: Wesleyan UP, 1973) 136–37

## Education
Saturday, 07 December 2019

“Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.”—Robert Frost

## Change
Monday, 09 December 2019

“Change breaks the brittle.”—Jan Houtema

## Simple Systems
Monday, 09 December 2019

“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.”—John Gall

Although known as “Gall’s Law” to software development gurus like Grady Booch and Ken Orr, Gall was a pediatrician and primarily interested in systems that support child rearing. in 1975 he wrote *Systemantics: How Systems Work and Especially How They Fail*. I’m inclined to think that it’s applicable to situations where those in power want to replace gradually developed economic or political systems with “more efficient” versions.

## Unlearning
Monday, 09 December 2019

“The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.”—[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html)

## Sunlight
Tuesday, 10 December 2019

“It is, after all, not necessary to fly right into the middle of the sun, but it is necessary to crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and one can warm oneself a little.”—Franz Kafka *Letter to my Father*

## Materialism
Saturday, 14 December 2019

“… Implicit Materialism—that is, an underlying, unexpressed, conception that material causes explain all things—survives. Men do not commonly say, nowadays, as many did not so long ago, that man is to be explained as a machine or a set of chemical formulae. They no longer, in any great numbers, deny flatly the presence the presence of immaterial factors in the universe. But when they speak of life or death, or when they propose an explanation of anything, they imply, often without knowing it, that all of which they talk is material: that life is a material process, death but the cessation of that process, and that any human occasion—for instance any social development—can be completely understood when it is stated in terms of material things.”—Hilaire Belloc: [*Survivals and New Arrivals*](https://oldthunderbelloc.blogspot.com/2014/10/survivals-and-new-arrivals-i-introductory.html)

## Live In It
Tuesday, 17 December 2019

“I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package, I'm just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.”—Joan Didion, excerpt from a commencement address, University of California, Riverside, 1975

## Poverty and Glory
Tuesday, 17 December 2019

“At the center of our being is a point of nothingness which is untouched by sin and by illusion, a point of pure truth, a point or spark which belongs entirely to God, which is never at our disposal, from which God disposes our lives, which is inaccessible to the fantasies of our own mind or the brutalities of our own will. This little point of nothingness and of absolute poverty is the pure glory of God in us. It is, so to speak, His name written in us…”—Thomas Merton, *Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander*

## Conflicts
Wednesday, 18 December 2019

“Political conflicts are merely surface manifestations. If conflicts arise you may be sure that certain powers intend to keep this conflict under operation since they hope to profit from the situation. To concern yourself with surface political conflicts is to make the mistake of the bull in the ring, you are charging the cloth. That is what politics is for, to teach you the cloth. Just as the bullfighter teaches the bull, teaches him to follow, obey the cloth.”—William S. Burroughs

## Hardware Gains
Thursday, 19 December 2019

“It is a testament to the genius of the software industry that it has neutralized the hardware gains of the last half century.”—John Gregg

## Method
Friday, 20 December 2019

“To understand the method which Pascal employs, the reader must be prepared to follow the process of the mind of the intelligent believer. The Christian thinker—and I mean the man who is trying consciously and conscientiously to explain to himself the sequence which culminated in faith, rather than the public apologist—proceeds by rejection and elimination. He finds the world to be so and so; he finds its character inexplicable by any non-religious theory; among religions he finds Christianity, and Catholic Christianity, to account most satisfactorily for the world and especially for the moral world within; and thus, by what Newman calls ‘powerful and concurrent’ reasons, he finds himself inexorably committed to the dogma of the Incarnation. To the unbeliever, this method seems disingenuous and perverse; for the unbeliever is, as a rule, not so greatly troubled to explain the world to himself, nor so greatly distressed by its disorder; nor is he generally concerned (in modern terms) to ‘preserve values.’ He does not consider that if certain emotional states, certain developments of character, and what in the highest sense can be called ‘saintliness’ are inherently and by inspection known to be good, then the satisfactory explanation of the world must be an explanation which will admit the ‘reality’ of these values. Nor does he consider such reasoning admissible; he would, so to speak, trim his values according to his cloth, because to him such values are of no great value. The unbeliever starts from the other end, and as likely as not with the question: Is a case of human parthenogenesis credible? and this he would call going straight to the heart of the matter. Now Pascal’s method is, on the whole, the method natural and right for the Christian; and the opposite method is that taken by Voltaire. It is worthwhile to remember that Voltaire, in his attempt to refute Pascal, has given once and for all the type of such refutation; and that later opponents of Pascal’s Apology for the Christian Faith have contributed little beyond psychological irrelevancies. For Voltaire has presented, better than any one since, what is the unbelieving point of view; and in the end we must all choose for ourselves between one point of view and another.”—[T.S. Eliot](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm)

## Hated
Sunday, 22 December 2019

“I was never more hated than when I tried to be honest.””—Ralph Ellison, *Invisible Man *

## Inversion
Tuesday, 24 December 2019

“In the new environment (post WWII, ed.), being “working class” became steadily less of a purchasing-power distinction and more one of culture, affiliation, and educational limits on upward mobility. A plumber might make more than an advertising copywriter per hour, but the copywriter could reasonably hope to run his own ad agency—or at least a corporate marketing department—some day. The plumber remained “working class” because, lacking his A-level, he could never hope to join the managerial elite.

“At the same time, state socialism was becoming increasingly appealing to the managerial and upper classes because it offered the prospect not of revolution but of a managed economy that would freeze power relationships into a shape they were familiar with and knew how to manipulate. This came to be seen as greatly preferable to the chaotic dynamism of unrestrained free markets—and to upper-SES people who every year feared falling into poverty less but losing relative status more, it really was preferable.”—[Eric Raymond](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8526)

## Insecure Bluster
Thursday, 26 December 2019

“Joseph Carter, in the article cited above, finds it natural to say, without blinking an eye, ‘As a materialist, I think …’—as if ‘material’ and ‘matter’ were perfectly routine concepts. Yet I doubt whether any philosopher of science today would be so rash as to venture a confident definition of ‘matter’. Certainly our technological know-how does little to lend it content.

“Much the same can be said of the terms often considered basic to science, such as energy, space, force, and time. Feynman himself remarked in his famous lectures that ‘we have no knowledge of what energy is’. Anyone who senses the disquieting shadow of the unknown enveloping our science will hardly pronounce upon the true nature of the ‘material’ world. To do so might only suggest a tendency toward insecure bluster and a habit of uncritical thinking.”—[Stephen L. Talbott](https://natureinstitute.org/txt/st/org/comm/ar/2018/meaning_33.htm)

## Warning Tags
Sunday, 29 December 2019

“Well over two thousand years ago, science as we know it was offered to the West with a warning tag attached to it: Use this, but don’t be tricked by it. And of course, impatient little children that we are, we tore off the tag and ignored the warning.”—Peter Kingsley, *Reality* (2003).

## Quotes
