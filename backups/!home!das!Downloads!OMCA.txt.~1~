I'm David Smith, I live here in Oakland Mills, and not surprisingly I'm going to talk about our high school and middle school.

I'm going to brag a bit, complain for a bit, then, because I'm a retired consultant, make a recommendation.

I live here because my granddaughters live here. Their mom decided that good schools with diverse student bodies were a top priority for raising her girls.

We're proud that Oakland Mills Middle and High schools offer such quality education, and we're proud that their student bodies are so diverse - that they're composed of such a high proportion of underrepresented races and ethnicities and have the highest percentages of students receiving meal assistance in the county. We are proud of Oakland Mills and of Oakland Mills' schools.

Now for the complaint - we've been hearing about how our secondary schools need critical maintenance - $111M for our High School - and the School Board hasn't even included it on the master plan to be done by fiscal 2030. You'll hear lots more this evening about the details, so all I'm going to say now is that this looks terrible. We talk the talk about being committed to diversity and equity, but when it comes to walking the walk, well, it doesn't look good. That doesn't sound good when I say it, imagine what it will sound like when the Balitimore Sun decides to do a hit piece on us with "hypocrisy" or worse in the headline.

But I'm not a complainer - I have a suggestion. I'm confident that there's a perfectly good explanation for this, and what we have is a failure to communicate. All the school board has to do, and do right away, is to explain, in detail, why things have gotten to this state and what's being planned to set it right.

Thank you.


===================================================

OMHS opened in 1973 and has not undergone systemic renovation. This means that core systems, such as heating and air conditioning, are original. The most recent major investment in OMHS was the 2004 addition. Unlike other schools that have received additions, OMHS did not receive a full renovation to the original parts of the building in the process.

According to a fiscal year 2020 school system document, there is almost $111 million in deferred maintenance at OMHS. To put this in perspective, the entire fiscal year 2021 capital budget request for HCPSS is about $102.3 million. The deferred maintenance on OMHS is the highest for any building in the school system.

A school system assessment of OMHS, conducted around 2018 concluded: "When originally deferred, this was a major HVAC renovation project; however it has been nine years since the project was deferred. Current conditions at the school now require a full renovation. Itâ€™s not practical and cost effective to maintain the system any longer." "Due to the fact that the system is old, obsolete and continues to be problematic we are unable to provide a conducive-learning environment to both the students and staff."

OMHS is not in the school system's long-range master plan that runs through fiscal year 2030. This means that the school system does not intend to make any major investment in OMHS until it is at least a 60 year old building.

The school system prioritizes projects that increase capacity; however, neither OMHS nor OMMS are being utilized to full capacity despite the school system's authority to adjust attendance areas to relieve overcrowding in surrounding schools. As of September 2020, OMMS had enrollment of 479 students and capacity for 506. OMHS had enrollment of 1,269 students and capacity for 1,400. By comparison, Howard High, which shares an attendance board with OMHS had enrollment of 1,828 with a capacity of 1,420. Dunloggin Middle had an enrollment of 624 with a capacity of 565. Not utilizing OMMS and OMHS to full capacity is also preventing capital investment in these buildings.

OMMS opened in 1972 and has over $51 million in deferred maintenance.

OMMS is in the long-range master plan for a renovation and addition, with occupancy anticipated in 2030. However, this project is not funded, and a recent Feasibility Study from the school system now recommends building an addition onto Thomas Viaduct Middle School instead of OMMS.

The combined $162 million in deferred maintenance on OMHS and OMMS represents 20 percent of all deferred maintenance across the school system. To put this in perspective, there were 1,748 students enrolled in OMMS and OMHS in 2020-2021 and 57,293 enrolled throughout HCPSS. OMMS and OMHS students make up only three percent of HCPSS enrollment, yet they must carry 20 percent of the deferred maintenance burden.
