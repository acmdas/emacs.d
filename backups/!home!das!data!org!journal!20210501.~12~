** 09:15 Had a long “meeting after the meeting” and suggested via text that Michael look for service opportunities.
** 12:46 Texted with Iana and sent Joc an email. Will go cut the grass now, I hope.
** 14:32 Grass is cut, back yard is getting watered - 30 minutes each area.

** 16:37 Did dishes, stripped chicken carcass, soup is on the boil for another half hour or so. Plan is to make chili. Valerie isn’t well again - bowels. Forecast proved correct - A/C is on.
** 16:51 There are currently five goldfinches on the back feeders.

** 10:48 Contacted BCBS, they have no record of receiving a bill for Maria 1/11/2021 from Medicare. Medicare says that they have no information about my secondary Part B coverage, which sounds bogus, but the lady got huffy when I asked about what worked for the previous 9 years, so I left it at that and wrote Hopkins a letter and suggested that they arrange something. That’s in the mailbox now. I also copied the letter contents to an online message that Hopkins won’t read (they promise to read within 24 hours but my last message hasn’t been read in a week). So that’s a PITA but I’ve done my bit for now. Finished/caught up on scanning.
** 14:26 Walked with Valerie, worked some on the Annual Meeting Minutes, can’t bring myself to listen to the audio yet.
** 16:26 Soup is pretty well made. Needs to cook down the veggies and add rice and chicken. Texted Adam S. that I won’t be at Men’s Dinner this week. Valerie is talking to Ans, Sophia spent a nice visit and just left.

** 21:38 A nice visit from Sophia, took Valerie to her appointment and shopped at Giant. RF tire was low, I pumped it up. Salmon and corn for supper.

** 10:50 Tire was only slightly lower, maybe from cold. Will keep an eye on it over the next few days. Planning to get IKEA cabinet on Monday if all goes well. RAC tonight. Walked with Michael 4.8 miles.
** 13:44 Rested after the walk, went to Giant and got peppermint tea and cheesecloth. Did dishes. Reconciled PNC and Chase accounts in GnuCash.

** 15:22 Bread is cooling on the counter. Cut the grass in the back yard. Valerie is talking to Ans now and it’s looking like she may be able to visit over Thanksgiving. Jackie and Graham won’t be here on Mothers’ Day after all. Rain started right on schedule around 1500.

** 06:54 2310-0551, 6:06 88. 43F partly cloudy, forecast 58F with rain showers this morning.
** 10:09 What’s going to heppen with the Bells for Mothers’ Day is still up in the air. My impression is that Miriam is leaning toward going to a restaurant. My impression is that it’s likely to be almost as busy as on Valentine’s Day, but I’m not going to try to drive the bus, just find out where and when to get on. Cathy asked about the Annual Meeting Report, so it’s time to listen to the audio recording.
** 11:05 I think I’m ready to begin listening to the audio - went outside and chopped the umbrella cardboard cover up so that it fits in the recycling bin. Valerie is going to shower, then go to Costco for a med at the pharmacy and maybe go to Lowes to look for a lawn sprinkler.
** 14:13 More than half way through the audio, FWIW.

** 23:03 Got the report off to Cathy around 4 or so, had a nap. Watched “Hot Fuzz”.

** 07:10 2347-0622, 6:12 90. 44F, overcast, forecast 64F and rain overnight. Mostly sunny and mid-60s next week, warming gradually. No rain forecast for 10 days after tonight. Good thing we got the sprinkler yesterday. Back yard grass is looking healthy, front is filling in.
** 07:22 TSA has issued me a precheck number. Now I just need my passport back and to renew my DL on June 7 and I’ll be ID’d for the next little while.
** 16:45 Just sent the draft Minutes to everyone. The Bells dropped by around 1400 to say “Hi” and drop off a flower for Valerie. The smoke alarm went off yet again this morning and Valerie has been rattled ever since. Likely going to dump the Kidde units and get something else. Maybe another from Frontpoint. Bells are coming back around 5 with sushi (tempura for Valerie). We’ve done a bit of tidying up. Haven’t mentioned it but it seems that Josie is dying and will check out any day now. Adriana is her caregiver and they seem to have patched up their relationship pretty well. 
** 21:58 Sushi dinner with the Bells - shrimp tempura for Valerie. Fine cake for dessert. A wonderful time was had by all.

** 07:09 2258-0619, 6:40 86. 55F overcast and windy, forecast 66F mostly sunny. 24-hour meditation today talks about calmness. I think of the Kipling poem “If” - “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you...”
** 14:13 Identified the rattle in the CR-V as coming from the muffler. Added a strap to the heat shield. Ran to Giant for milk, eggs and bananas. Nyger seed from Mother Nature. Refilled the bird sock. Moved the smaller brown book case to the guest bedroom.
** 16:17 Restarted to load new init.el with all the commented-out elfeed listings removed. It loaded a lot of those commented-out blogs today - I marked everything read and we’ll see what happens now.
** 21:45 Small Men’s Meeting this time - Ray, Jay, John and me. Adam’s father spoke.
