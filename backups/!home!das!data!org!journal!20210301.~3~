** 09:37 It was the code for Nigel’s meeting that was off - he gave the correct one during the speaker meeting that I didn’t attend.
** 10:24 Sitting on hold to get the delivery of Entresto arranged. 25 minutes or so and counting. At least the music is classical piano - Mozart, maybe Back, like that.
** 12:00 I’ve talked with one person, am now waiting to talk with the pharmacy. 
** 14:06 Still waiting - I’ve put the phone back on the charger - being on hold for 4 hours ate 45% of its power.
** 17:06 They came on line and took my phone number. Called back around 1615 - meds will be here Wednesday.

** 07:03 2316-0624, 6:24 82. Sunny and windy, 27F.
** 17:57 Spent some time organizing more of the War Story letters, added to the outline. Edited another chapter of Poetic Diction. We took a short walk. Plan to go to Mission BBQ or somewhere else and watch a movie tonight.
** 22:45 Ate Chinese, watched some more Harry Potter shorts, then the first Magritte epesode. Heavy, but very well done. Will want to look for Poirot - the ABC Murders on Amazon Prime.
