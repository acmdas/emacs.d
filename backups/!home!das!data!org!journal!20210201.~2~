** 07:41 0014-0706, 6:10 86. Made it to 3rd Step.
** 08:49 Overcast, forecast is snow showers turning to light snow, temps like yesterday. Valerie’s still asleep so I’ll wait until she gets up to finish dressing and take the birds their feed.
** 11:04 She got up around 9, we had rolled oats.
** 13:38 Actually working on the January Vestry minutes. Imagine that. All the backups are run and copied around as planned.
** 16:19 Left listening to the Vestry audio for later.
** 18:03 We walked to Miriam’s and picked up eggs and coffee that she’d gotten for us at Wegman’s.
** 21:26 We made a great dinner with a chicken breast, potatoes and zucchini, all roast for 40 minutes or so. With a salad. Mmmm
** 22:43 About to climb into a tub. Mmmm again.
