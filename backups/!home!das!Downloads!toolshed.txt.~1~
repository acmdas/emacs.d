I was standing today in the dark toolshed. The
sun was shining outside and through the crack at
the top of the door there came a sunbeam. From
where I stood that beam of light, with the specks
of dust floating in it, was the most striking thing in
the place. Everything else was almost pitch-black.
I was seeing the beam, not seeing things by it.
Then I moved, so that the beam fell on my
eyes. Instantly the whole previous picture
vanished. I saw no toolshed, and (above all) no
beam. Instead I saw, framed in the irregular cranny
at the top of the door, green leaves moving on the
branches of a tree outside and beyond that, 90 odd
million miles away, the sun. Looking along the
beam, and looking at the beam are very different
experiences.
But this is only a very simple example of the
difference between looking at and looking along. A
young man meets a girl. The whole world looks
different when he sees her. Her voice reminds him
of something he has been trying to remember all
his life, and ten minutes casual chat with her is
more precious than all the favours that all other
women in the world could grant. lie is, as they say,
“in love”. Now comes a scientist and describes this
young man's experience from the outside. For him
it is all an affair of the young man's genes and a
recognised biological stimulus. That is the difference between looking along the sexual impulse
and looking at it.

When you have got into the habit of making this distinction you will find examples of it all day long. The mathematician sits thinking, and to him it seems that he is contemplating timeless and spaceless truths about quantity. But the cerebral physiologist, if he could look inside the mathematician's head, would find nothing timeless and spaceless there - only tiny movements in the
grey matter. The savage dances in ecstasy at midnight before Nyonga and feels with every muscle that his dance is helping to bring the new green crops and the spring rain and the babies. The anthropologist, observing that savage, records that he is performing a fertility ritual of the type soand-so. The girl cries over her broken doll and feels that she has lost a real friend; the psychologist says that her nascent maternal instinct has been temporarily lavished on a bit of shaped and coloured wax.

As soon as you have grasped this simple
distinction, it raises a question. You get one
experience of a thing when you look along it and
another when you look at it. Which is the “true” or
“valid” experience? Which tells you most about
the thing? And you can hardly ask that question
without noticing that for the last fifty years or so
everyone has been taking the answer for granted. It
has been assumed without discussion that if you
want the true account of religion you must go, not
to religious people, but to anthropologists; that if
you want the true account of sexual love you must
go, not to lovers, but to psychologists; that if you
want to understand some “ideology” (such as
medieval chivalry or the nineteenth-century idea of
a “gentleman”), you must listen not to those who
lived inside it, but to sociologists.
The people who look at things have had it all
their own way; the people who look along things
have simply been brow-beaten. It has even come
to be taken for granted that the external account of
a thing somehow refutes or “debunks” the account
given from inside. “All these moral ideals which
look so transcendental and beautiful from inside”,
says the wiseacre, “are really only a mass of
biological instincts and inherited taboos.” And no
one plays the game the other way round by
replying, “If you will only step inside, the things
that look to you like instincts and taboos will
suddenly reveal their real and transcendental
nature.”

That, in fact, is the whole basis of the
specifically “modern” type of thought. And is it
not, you will ask, a very sensible basis? For, after
all, we are often deceived by things from the
inside. For example, the girl who looks so
wonderful while we're in love, may really be a very
plain, stupid, and disagreeable person. The
savage's dance to Nyonga does not really cause the
crops to grow. Having been so often deceived by
looking along, are we not well advised to trust only
to looking at? in fact to discount all these inside
experiences?
Well, no. There are two fatal objections to
discounting them all. And the first is this. You
discount them in order to think more accurately.
But you can't think at all - and therefore, of course,
can't think accurately - if you have nothing to
think about. A physiologist, for example, can
study pain and find out that it “is” (whatever is
means) such and such neural events. But the word
pain would have no meaning for him unless he had
“been inside” by actually suffering. If he had never
looked along pain he simply wouldn't know what
he was looking at. The very subject for his
inquiries from outside exists for him only because
he has, at least once, been inside.

This case is not likely to occur, because every
man has felt pain. But it is perfectly easy to go on
all your life giving explanations of religion, love,
morality, honour, and the like, without having been
inside any of them. And if you do that, you are
simply playing with counters. You go on
explaining a thing without knowing what it is. That
is why a great deal of contemporary thought is,
strictly speaking, thought about nothing - all the
apparatus of thought busily working in a vacuum.

The other objection is this: let us go back to
the toolshed. I might have discounted what I saw
when looking along the beam (i.e., the leaves
moving and the sun) on the ground that it was
“really only a strip of dusty light in a dark shed”.
That is, I might have set up as “true” my “side
vision” of the beam. But then that side vision isitself an instance of the activity we call seeing.
And this new instance could also be looked at from
outside. I could allow a scientist to tell me that
what seemed to be a beam of light in a shed was
“really only an agitation of my own optic nerves”.
And that would be just as good (or as bad) a bit of
debunking as the previous one. The picture of the
beam in the toolshed would now have to be
discounted just as the previous picture of the trees
and the sun had been discounted. And then, where
are you?

In other words, you can step outside one
experience only by stepping inside another.
Therefore, if all inside experiences are misleading,
we are always misled. The cerebral physiologist
may say, if he chooses, that the mathematician's
thought is “only” tiny physical movements of the
grey matter. But then what about the cerebral
physiologist's own thought at that very moment?
A second physiologist, looking at it, could
pronounce it also to be only tiny physical
movements in the first physiologist's skull. Where
is the rot to end?

The answer is that we must never allow the rot
to begin. We must, on pain of idiocy, deny from
the very outset the idea that looking at is, by its
own nature, intrinsically truer or better than
looking along. One must look both along and at
everything. In particular cases we shall find reason
for regarding the one or the other vision as inferior.
Thus the inside vision of rational thinking must be
truer than the outside vision which sees only
movements of the grey matter; for if the outside
vision were the correct one all thought (including
this thought itself) would be valueless, and this is
self-contradictory. You cannot have a proof that
no proofs matter. On the other hand, the inside
vision of the savage's dance to Nyonga may be
found deceptive because we find reason to believe
that crops and babies are not really affected by it.
In fact, we must take each case on its merits. But we must start with no prejudice for or against either kind of looking. We do not know in advance whether the lover or the psychologist is giving the more correct account of love, or whether both accounts are equally correct in different ways, or whether both are equally wrong. We just have to find out. But the period of brow-beating has got to end.
