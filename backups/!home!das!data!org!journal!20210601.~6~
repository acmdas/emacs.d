** 07:27 2351-0711, 6:41 86. 73F partly cloudy. Made it to the meeting, have to leave early to be ready for my 0900 at the MVA. Also meeting with Maria @ 1215.
** 12:12 Made it to the MVA for my appointment, but learned that I can’t renew until after June 30. I’ll try again in July. Waiting to go online with Maria now.
** 17:10 Mim and Vivi dropped by after school. Watering the front garden - hydrangeas and roses mostly. They looked great this morning, very droopy at midday. Will try to get the hose on the back yard after tonight’s meeting.
** 21:42 Hose is on the back yard, timer set for 30 minutes. Good meeting, Joyce dropped by.
** 22:15 Water is off - sudoku is won, no reason not to have cereal and hit the sack.
