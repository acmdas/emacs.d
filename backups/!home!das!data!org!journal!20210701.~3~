** 07:17 2317-0614, 6:10 84. 72F cloudy, forecast 83F showers and thunderstorms.
** 07:20 Happy Canada Day!
** 07:38 Adriana asked about Craig - he’s been evacuated with the fire only a mile fron the trailer. On his way to Rawleen’s in Kamloops as of 2300.
** 12:17 Went to Mother Nature’s and got safflower seed, and to Giant for a card and gift bag, and to deposit my Canada Pension check. All the major backups are run and copied to the WDBook. Not yet copied to the offsite drives. Turning to RAC business now.
** 17:13 Think I’m ready for RAC. Had a nap, had a shower. Valerie talked with Craig again and with Ans. The /data backup is copied to WDBook and Offsite2, /media is copying to Media as I type.
** 19:09 Fed, cleaned-up, about ready for the RAC performance.
** 23:00 RAC went well, I’d say. Finished by 2100. Still have three tabled apps. Craig heard that his trailer survived the fire.

** 06:50 2335-0604, 5:53 81. 68F cloudy, forecast 81F some showers this morning. 44th Anniversary, Joe’s Birthday today.
** 09:33 Washed dishes and am boiling eggs. Valerie is planning to go to Aquafit in a bit. Downloaded a pdf of “Lisp in Small Pieces” and converted it to epub.
** 17:05 Washed delicates, Valerie is pleased with her perfume, I’m happy with the Magic Flute dvd and the plug converters for the Amsterdam trip. We’re off to dinner at PF Chang at 1800.
** 19:28 And we’re home. Valerie had tempura shrimp rolls, I had chicken pad thai. Very nice spring rolls to get started. Took a stroll around the mall, got an estimate to resize her ring, and so to home. She seems to have enjoyed it a lot.
