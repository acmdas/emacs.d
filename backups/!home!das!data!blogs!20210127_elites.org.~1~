“The secret of the elites is that they're not all that smart so they need the deck stacked to continue the illusion that they are elite at all.”—Rob Peffer

He's absolutely right. That's why the fake elite devotes 100 percent of their collective effort to trying to maintain the illusion and keep the deck stacked. It's also why nationalism and populism terrify them. They know their power and influence could be broken literally overnight by a sufficiently angry populace.

This is no longer about ideology. All the idearrhea about "liberal" and "conservative" and "communism" and "objectivism" is a veil to obscure the realities of the stacked deck. It's about lawless rule by a small, mostly foreign and self-appointed fake elite. They all have imposter syndrome because they are all imposters.
