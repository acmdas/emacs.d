** 07:16 2320-0634, 6:34 89. Raining, 40F. We go to TSAPreCheck clearance at Staples today at 1300.
** 15:08 Got my application in - discovered that I need to renew my passport, and nobody seems to take passport pictures these days. Valerie’s application bombed out because of her old green card. I’ve completed her application for replacement - the fee is over $500!
** 21:21 RAC went well. Going to be a chilly night - the new plants that Valerie bought the other day are all in the kitchen overnight.
