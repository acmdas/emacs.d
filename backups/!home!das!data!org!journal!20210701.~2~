** 07:17 2317-0614, 6:10 84. 72F cloudy, forecast 83F showers and thunderstorms.
** 07:20 Happy Canada Day!
** 07:38 Adriana asked about Craig - he’s been evacuated with the fire only a mile fron the trailer. On his way to Rawleen’s in Kamloops as of 2300.
** 12:17 Went to Mother Nature’s and got safflower seed, and to Giant for a card and gift bag, and to deposit my Canada Pension check. All the major backups are run and copied to the WDBook. Not yet copied to the offsite drives. Turning to RAC business now.
** 17:13 Think I’m ready for RAC. Had a nap, had a shower. Valerie talked with Craig again and with Ans. The /data backup is copied to WDBook and Offsite2, /media is copying to Media as I type.
** 19:09 Fed, cleaned-up, about ready for the RAC performance.
** 23:00 RAC went well, I’d say. Finished by 2100. Still have three tabled apps. Craig heard that his trailer survived the fire.
