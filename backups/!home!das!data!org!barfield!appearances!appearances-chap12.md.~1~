# XII<br/>SOME CHANGES

In the first chapter of this book it was pointed out that our collective representations compose, not only the world of everyday experience, but also the world which (apart from the special case of physics) is investigated by the sciences. Science did not, of course, betin with the scientific revolution. But in the time before that had done its work, the world with which science had to deal was not that of our own day, but a world of the kind sketched in the last chapter. If, to take only one instance, we look at the theories concerning the blood and its circulation which prevailed before Harvey, we can at once see from their whole character that they represent the application of alpha-thinking to representations quite other than our own. The background-picture of man as microcosm at the centre of the world as macrocosm was more than a background-picture for science. There, and in particular in their chemistry, which we should now call alchemy, that picture became explicit as theory. And where it was not explicit, it was still implied. But it went further than this. Just as for us evolution, for instance, besides being both a background-picture and an explicit theory, has spread itself as a way of thinking, far beyond the confines of biology; or as mechanism has passed from physics into chemistry and physiology; so the medieval background-picture, of a reciprocal participation between man and the elements by which he was surrounded, influenced other sciences besides alchemy. Thus, in medicine, the heart was the central organ, occupying something the same position in the microcosm of man, as did man himself in the macrocosm. It drew the blood into itself, in order to replenish it with *pneuma* or ‘vital spirits’, after which the blood passed of its own motion back again into the system of the body. Instead of a circulation, there were two different kinds of blood; the arterial, whose function has just been described, and which contained those vital spirits to which we still unknowingly refer when we speak of ‘high’ or ‘low’ spirits; and the venous, which flowed back and forth in the veins, conveying nourishment.

We saw in Chapter IV that anthropologists have been particularly struck by the difference between those features which we ourselves select for attention out of the whole representation, and the features which a participating consciousness selects. This seems to be well exemplified in the case of blood, as it appeared and was known before the seventeenth century. The medieval mind was not particularly interested in the mechanical part of the representation; on the other hand, it was much more vividly aware than we are of a qualitative difference between arterial blood and venous blood. Are we sure we are justified in ruling out the possibility that *participated* venous blood and participated arterial blood are to different kinds of fluid? It is indeed remarkable that earlier still, and down to the time of Galen, this was how it was imagined, and not as the same fluid ‘circulating’.

Harvey, on the other hand, was definitely interested in the *mechanism* of the heart—even to the extent of talking of the heart as ‘a piece of machinery in which, though one wheel gives motion to another, yet all the wheels seem to move simultaneously’. This enabled him ultimately to demonstrate the circulation of the blood. And his discovery, like many of the discoveries made in the non-mechanical sciences, had two clearly traceable consequences. On the one hand, it corrected a number of palpable mechanical errors—for instance, the belief that the air passed directly from the lungs to the heart, and that the blood flowed both ways through the veins. On the other hand, it contributed towards the bringing about of an exclusively mechanomorphic view of both blood and heart.

The second consequence took effect only gradually. Harvey himself still assumed the presence of vital spirits and he retained enough participating consciousness to write with enthusiasm on the subject of the heart as the central organ—like a sort of sun—of the human body. The like enthusiasm is observable in Copernicus writing of the ‘macrocosmic’ sun; and it is clear that a relation between the two was assumed by both men. For Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood was based, quite consciously, upon two Aristotelian and medieval doctrines, namely, the participating and formal relation between macrocosm and microcosm to which I have already referred in this chapter, and the ‘perfection’ of circular motion to which I referred earlier in the book. Thus, the ousting of participation is not a *logical* consequence of a more accurate observation of the mechanical element in any representation; it is a practical one. If we are present at a church service, where a censer is swinging, we may either attend to the whole representation or we may select for attention the actual movement to and fro of the censer. In the latter case, if we are a Galileo,¹ we may discover the law of the pendulum. It is a good thing to discover the law of the pendulum. It is not such a good thing to lose, for that reason, all interest, and untimately even perception of, the incense whose savour it was the whole purpose of the pendulum to release. Participation ceases to be conscious precisely because we cease to attend to it. But, as already pointed out, participation does not cease to be a fact because it ceases to be conscious. It merely ceases to be what I have called ‘original’ participation.

From a slightly different point of view, all of this could be expressed by saying that words like *blood* and *heart* have shifted their meanings. In maintaining this, I shall of course be accused of confusing the word with the thing. But this is a fallacy. The real confusing lies hidden in the indictment. It is indeed possible, when thinking of the relation between words and things, to forget what ‘things’, that is phenomena, are; namely, that they are collective representations and, as such, correlative to human consciousness. But those who decline to adopt this expedient, will find it impossible to sever the ‘thing’ by a sort of surgical operation from its name. The relation between collective representations and language is of the most intimate nature; and if charges of muddled thinking are to be brought, I do not hesitate to say that the boot is on the other leg. those who insist that words and things are in two mutually exclusive categories of reality are simply confusing the phenomena with the particles. They are trying to think about the former as though they were the latter. Whereasm by definition, it is only the unrepresented which is independent of collective human consciousness and therefore of human language.

The word *blood* is a particularly striking example of such a shift of meaning, since it is a substance with which, as it swings to and from from heart and lung at the centre to visible complexion and sensitive skin at the periphery, we can still in some measure feel ourselves to be united by an extra-sensory link. We can, for example, both feel within ourselves and see through the curtain of another’s flesh how instantly it answers to fear and shame. Thus, we still participate ‘originally’ in our own blood up to the very moment when it becomes phenomenal by being shed. From that moment on, we abandon it to the mechanomorphism which characterizes all our phenomena. For us—that is, for our casual awareness, though not for our scientific concepts—there are really two kinds of blood: the shed and the unshed; rather as for Galen there were two kinds of blood, the venous and the arterial. Both of Galen’s were participated; whereas only *one* of ours is. We refer to what remains of that participation when we speak, with a psychological intention, of ‘bad blood’ or ‘hot blood’. We no longer distinguish where he did. We do distinguish where he did not, polarizing the old meaning of *blood* into two, a metaphorical and a literal one. And our medicine interests itself almost exclusively in the literal one, that it, in the idol.
