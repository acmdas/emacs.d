Getting 1911 ready to go shooting with Jesse tomorrow. Not going to do too much - run a patch through the barrel, see what it looks like. Will take a few hundred rounds - sure to not shoot that much, but why not? Better to not run out before I’m ready to stop.

** 16:33 Managed to see Tina and get a haircut. Valerie was asleep in her chair when I got home, I had a shower. Mim’s delivery went smoothly - she got home seconds after the truck arrived. When I got home I removed the fabric covers from the trees and shrubs in the front.

** 13:04 Just had a very nice FaceTime with Adriana. She ran out of battery, so we’ll do it again soon. Cait will be visiting soon and leaving the boys in Squamish for the summer, so we’ll do some FaceTimes with them in the coming months.
** 18:06 It’s hot out there!
** 22:17 Watched two episodes of season 4 of GOT. Finished hash. Valerie is talking to Craig. I sent e-cards to the fathers on our list, including Ray, Joe N., all family. Haven’t heard from Mim - she’s probably tied up with getting the girls ready to go to Camp Letts.

Got 1” of rain from Monday night through yesterday afternoon, cool all day yesterday and last night. About 52F this morning, clear, forecast 77F. Full moon tomorrow. Mim has asked me to help prep the girls’ rooms for painting when I get back from walking with Michael.
** 13:05 Got things started with Mim, attended the nooner, getting ready to go back to Mim’s. Vestry tonight.
** 22:32 The Vestry special meeting was to clarify what the relationship is between the rector and the vestry, since Cathy was uncomfortable with the discussion we had during the previous Executive session, and went to Tom about it. Probably wasn’t entirely necessary, but was still productive. Tom was very king to me afterward, suggesting that my comments were helpful and interesting.

** 07:23 Rain has stopped already. 76 indoors already. Joining the morning meeting now. Tripped over (on HN) a new blog - Christine Dodrill’s - odd but maybe worth exploring.
** 09:54 Bread is on first rise - 20 minutes to go. Dishes done. Valerie took a walk to the pool to watch the kids meet. The Bells weren’t there, but Brielle proves to be a butterfly expert first time out. Good for her!
** 10:22 Bread on second rise. Emacs updated.
** 16:37 Bread turned out well. It’s hot outside! Valerie is preparing bean salad for tomorrow’s picnic.
** 22:30 Watched another GOT, ran into Robert Anton Wilson via Discordianism via Christine Dodrill. His “Quantum Psychology” looks like another version of Barfield’s approach to perception.
