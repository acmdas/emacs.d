** 15:18 Walked with Michael, cut front and back yards, had a shower, got Zoom going for Valerie than attended the nooner. My travel laundry is in the dryer. Getting 1911 ready to go shooting with Jesse tomorrow. Not going to do too much - run a patch through the barrel, see what it looks like. Will take a few hundred rounds - sure to not shoot that much, but why not? Better to not run out before I’m ready to stop.
