** 08:16 Welcome to December! Fitbit says that I didn't sleep worth a damn - 0140-0702, 4:38 71. Valerie has an appt at 0900 w. Dr. Lazris' office, and set her alarm for 0700. I might have been awake that late - Valerie asked for a bath rather late after we'd spent a while watching Valentina Lisitsa, so it's certainly possible. Oh, well, my day is entirely open other than normal backup chores. Did the media drive last evening and overnight - finished at 0553. Started data at 0741 and it's almost a third done. All going to WDBOOK now - will have to be then copied to the remote drives. It's totally overcast, 39F now.
** 09:54 Valerie is home, told to stop taking one of the meds that eases her back pains, and wear compression socks. The data backup is almost done, will then do the home, gnucash and email tars. Hope to dig into the shed and locate the plane for Bruce and the chisels that I surely held onto. If they're all gone, I'll check with Adam - I might have given some to him and possibly more than I'd intended to. If all goes well I might even get started with the Vestry Minutes for November.
** 10:08 data backup will finish shortly - with all the epubs added to Calibre I'm not sure what the final size will be. Will pause to do the smaller backups and get them in the box.
** 10:37 Backups seem to be done, if not distributed to offline drives & etc.
** 14:04 Finished a run through the Carport shed, found the planes and chisels, too. Just have to give a touch-up to the jack plane iron and get it to Bruce. Pretty chilly - Valerie is shopping. I'm going to warm up a bit before I get back to work. data backup copying to the offline drive - 136.7GB of 370.0GB. 
** 19:02 213GB done, 157GB still to go. I got the plane iron sharpened and off to Bruce. Valerie had a good shopping run. We lay down for a rest and went out. Before that we took a plant to Miriam and she told us about the Google Fi plan to subscribe for $15/mo and get a Pixel 4a with protection for two years and a free upgrade. Valerie's phone isn't behaving well, so I did the deed for her - we'll get up to $27 for hers on return! I guess that will mean finding a protective cover for her.
** 21:51 And it's ordered. data and media are copied to offsite2.

** 09:06 Awoke at 0740, feel like I slept right through. Fitbit says 0058-0739, 6:01 79. Not a lot of deep sleep or awake, a fair bit of REM starting right at 0400. Got into rearranging the emacsnotes file, pulled out all of the org-related to a separate help file. Have to remember today we host the noon Al-Anon, and I can't eat solid food after 1340 because of the CT scan at 1540.
** 15:12 Got a call from Maria with a plan for using a new med named "entresto" - and I've spent most of the rest of the day so far dealing with getting it without paying almost $300/mo. Plan now is to get a written Rx and take it to Feldman's near Costco. I have a coupon from Novartis for a free month. In theory, I'll then get a year at $10/mo copay. We'll see. Now I'm off to Advanced Radiology.
** 18:32 The CT Scan went smoothly, drove by Nika's and no sign of anyone nor any notes on the doors. Fixed hash, which is simmering now. 
** 22:11 Dinner was first rate. Worked on selecting more of the downloaded ebooks, installed several in Calibre.

** 08:50 Good sleep: 2354-0743, 6:58 83. Up once around 0500, awoke pretty alert. Valerie is off to Aqua Fit soon. Expecting a call from Maria's office about a paper Rx. Call with Ben at 1100. RAC tonight.
** 10:35 The birdseed is decanted into containers, and the feeders are out. The Rx is ready at the office whenever I can get there. Valeris is away and Ben will call in 25 minutes. When we're finished with Ben I'll take the car, I think. Need to get the Rx, go to Feldman's and Aldi and Costco Gas, check one or two of the RAC sites. Maybe check Trader Joe's for Japanese Rice, too.
** 14:50 Back from Elkridge - got the meds with no problem, gas, didn't get Valerie's toothbrush refills, good stuff at Aldi and struck out at Trader Joe's. They said to come on Thursday first thing. Valerie is heading to the P.O.
** 16:49 She got to the P.O. without her purse, I took the package and the line was huge - used the self service device and was out of there in a few minutes. Took books back to the library, visited three RAC houses.
** 23:05 Ended the RAC with a headache - base of the skull pain - don't know what from. Maybe too much screen time. Anyway, off to have a soak.

** 21:37 Slept only fair - 1137-0728, 6:09, 76. I'm 100% certain that I wrote this around 0900 this morning, but oh, well. I did update git, which I guess could have goofed something at some point. No matter. Didn't get out at all today - Valerie did some errands before her meeting, then she talked with Susan and Ans. I was on a call with Lynn when there were some troubles getting connected with Facetime, but it worked out eventually. The talk with Lynn was good - and long. I suggested that she, Bill and Jonathan work out the priorities that Sandy should work on - Letters of Compliance, Complaints, etc. etc., and work out some guidelines for managing her time and also members' expectations. Letters requested less than a week/two weeks before closing incur and extra $500 fee, complaints not involving immediate risk to life and limb will be addressed within a month, not 5 days, that sort of thing. Then, when the package is put together, ask whether it's reasonably a one-person job. If not, come up with the $$ to pay for more hours, or change the package. She liked the idea and I offered to take part in the process if they wanted. She also felt me out for being on the Board - I said maybe just for the 3 months remaining on Larry's term. While Valerie was talking with Susan I moved a lot of stuff from my office to the "Back Room" including the scanner. Also got scanning papers caught up. Added Ben's tasks to my ToDo list.

** 09:41 Decent night's sleep: 0037-0829, 6:50 84. Sunny, time to get dressed and take the bird feeders outside. 44F outside, predicted high 48.
** 10:10 Valerie's new phone will arrive on Monday.
** 10:55 Got a suspicious email from Cathy Gates, sent her a text asking about it, and didn't look up the line of emails to see that Jan had sent one saying that Cathy's had been hacked. I responded finally saying that I'd be glad to help, and just got a typical fraud - a stupid one, asking me to buy some apple gift cards for her niece since Cathy is out of town. I decided to play it out for a while like that comedian does, responded by playing dumb about apples this time of year - winesaps and fujis, pretended that I knew the nieces, and offered to go to the beach and help if that's where she was. Let's see how long I can string this out.
** 13:49 No more from the fraudster. Valerie's Pixel 4a arrived. We charged it and transferred from her Motorola G6. A pretty easy process, didn't even need to fiddle with the sim card. It's working and she's happy with it. It'll take a while to get everything back to the way she wanted it, and it's newer than mine so of course the UI is completely different. Or maybe that's a setting. At any rate, it's working.
** 13:54 I got Carlo Rovelli's "The Order of Time" from the library - I'll check it out and if it seems really good I'll get it on Kindle. Last night I started to look at the Farley Mowatt "Farfarers" and then while finding it tripped over Francis Pryor's "Britain in the Middle Ages". Then got samples of his "Home" and "Britain AD" - might add those to my Christmas List. In face, I will add them, and right now.
** 15:58 Had trouble with DNS again, and it looks like my settings were reset to 192.168.1.1 again. So that's Verizon's DNS not necessarily Cloudflare's that's idiotic (or evil). I read a bunch of things and other than going to Arch or BSD and not having tons of stupid daemons trying to make DHCP work when I don't want it to, I decided to put the +i immutable bit on resolv.conf and I'm about to reboot. Fingers crossed. At least this time I'll check right away to see whether it's been changed anyway. Then we'll see whether Cloudflare is stupid (or evil), too.
** 16:06 Rebooted and resolv.conf is unchanged. So far, so good. However, Cloudflare is unable to connect to archive.is, which means that they're still not recognizing EDNS addresses/servers. So now we try a different DNS server.
** 16:17 Reset to DNSWatch service. Now to reboot again and see what happens.
** 16:26 We're on DNSWatch service, and we are getting to that archive.is site that Cloudflare didn't know anything about, that's the good part. The bad part is that connections seem to be phenomenally slow. Checking the Speedtest site, ping=11ms, Download=857.52Mbps, and Upload=0.00. The MacBook, on Cat5, is 9ms, 743.38Mbps and 753.74 Mbps, so it isn't Fios. Obviously, minos isn't getting 0.00 upload, but the test is timing out, which sounds right. I'm going to go back to Verizon (i.e., 192.168.1.1) for a test just to be sure that it isn't a matter of my blowing out a network card while rebooting (this is old hardware, although not as old as the server boards). So, we'll try that and get back to you.
** 17:07 So, it's getting weirder. I logged into the router to check the Verizon DNS server addresses, and I see that the router, and thus the 192.168.1.1 setting that we were starting with this morning, is set to Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1. Before the implications of that dawned on me, I got the local Verizon DNS addresses and tried them. Loading theoldreader.com was terribly slow, gmail better, and archive.is unknown. So I essentially unded everything by removing the immutable bit, rebooted (and the file was overwritten like before) and DNS is fast. Archive.is is still "unable to connect" but at least the error shows right away. Speedtest is Ping=11ms, Download=874.67Mbps, and upload=319.09MBPS. Not brilliant, but better than before by a wide margin. 
** 22:29 Valerie prepared a complicated but tasty chicken and sausage casserole in the Dutch oven. Now I'm going to work on a one-page summary of 2020 to include in Christmas cards.

** 11:40 I slept in to 0850 and slept pretty well: 0108-0850, 6:36 80. Have been struggling with the backup drives and have settled on a process of opening GParted upon rebooting to verify which device names go with each label. Things had gotten somewhat scrambled. Think things are more or less settled, but may want to get a larger drive to install internally to take backups.
** 12:23 Fired-up the Windows machine (Kootenay) and it seems that finishing the installation and activating Windows was a nothing-burger. Updates are installing, so unless something else happens, I'll try installing my latest Windows Office, XP or something that was new 20 years ago, and can consider using TurboTax on Windows instead of the Mac. And Emacs and other tools. At least it's there and works reasonably fast, unlike before. At that point I'll have the option of swapping power leads to the other drives and playing with OpenBSD, FreeBSD, maybe Arch Linux, something where there are fewer surprises from the OS.
** 12:28 Just boiled eggs.
** 18:07 Ordered a 3Tb drive from NewEgg - $10 cheaper than Amazon at the cost of a few days' longer delivery. That will put the equivalent of WDBOOK indoors, and add "backup" to "data" and "media" to my onboard folders. Valerie wanted to go to Dick Blick's in Baltimore, so I drove her up and back. Not a pleasant drive, I-95 and interior Baltimore, not my favorite thing.
** 18:49 Supper was a reprise of last night's - delightful. It's almost all gone now. Valerie has a Knitters' Zoom at 1900, and I'm expecting a text from Adriana about then that she's ready for a FaceTime chat with me. I did write our one-page "David and Valerie's 2020" and got it printed on all of the Christmas paper we had. Sadly, a fair bit of it got ruined by my not understanding that Microsoft and Apple run the printer differently. Ptah.
** 18:56 Kootenay's Windows build is updated and rebooted. Good enough for now.
** 22:37 Hoped for a chat with Adriana this evening, but it didn't happen. Did stay busy doing something or other - fiddling with ebooks, probably.

** 08:53 Slept 0031-0747, 6:08 77. Good enough for a Monday. Almost out of the Wegmans low-caf Arabica so 100% Folgers French Roast today. Decided to go with a half mug to start, just now starting my second half-mug. No sign of neurological oddity (vision, balance, etc.) so it does seem like caffeine is the culprit. Hope to talk with Adriana sometime today, Valerie has yoga at 1130, and we have meetings at 2000. Minutes would be a good thing to knock off - also some phone calls to get the ball rolling on ToDos like colinoscopy, estate plan, etc. Probably get a shower in at some point.
** 11:11 Took the meds 10-15 minutes ago, and now my vision is wonky. Whether it's coffee and the meds, the meds together, one particular med, one particular mfgr of one particular med - hard to say at this point. Have been taking evening meds fairly late - maybe tonight remember to take them with dinner and see what happens. Don't think it's the new one, the symptom is older than that. Anyway, shower time. Will be careful in the tub.
** 11:53 Showered, shaved, dressed. Vision is better, not quite perfect. Was very careful in the shower, but didn't really feel dizzy at all. Was going through morefieldstones.md and html correcting minor typos - am back to mid-August. Lots of good quotes.
** 14:01 Had lunch, updated foreign.md with notions that it needs to not just go back but to go forward and take current physics into consideration somehow. Including the notion that there really isn't anything like "time", that "there aren't any objects, only events."
** 18:48 Took a good walk with Valerie, had a bit of a lie-down, fixed salmon, rice and broccoli. Adriana is too busy for a call today, so we're hanging out until 2000 and our meetings.
** 21:55 Meetings went ok - mine anyway. Valerie is pretty down, neither of us know just why other than 2020. So it goes. The Minnie's Marbles check came today, BTW.

** 09:32 Today, it seems that I slept better than I thought - fitbit says 0038-0819, 6:38 86. My impression was that I was dreaming a lot, but apparently only a little between 0630 and 0700. Shows what I know. Valerie was awake and reading at some point - she said she'd taken a xanax and is still asleep now, so I'm not dressed. Haven't taken the meds yet, did pour a full mug of joe without thinking, and drank the first half fairly quickly, but kept sipping. No sign of wonkiness. Beginning to think that there's something in the morning meds, either individually or together. Really should think of a plan to investigate. Perhaps take the carbamazipene and the entresto first. I take those at night, and it seems that it didn't cause any issues last night. If it does now, perhaps it's an interaction with caffeine? If I'm still 100% by, say, 1015, then take the atorvistatin, and then later, metoprolol. Not yet really a careful experiment, but better than just knocking them all back and not learning much.
** 10:02 Valerie is up, and we found her "happy light" in case that helps.
** 12:23 Spent some time trying to get my head around Magit - with very limited success. Clearly I need to get good at translating between a posted configuration using use-package and my, old-fashioned package.el. Pthaat! Another time.
** 15:46 Accomplishment! The cork board in the Studio is hung and the mess is vacuumed up. There may be some tools lying about, but it's largely done. We just got back from a fairly short walk. My back is a bit sore, so I'm going to lie down for a bit.
** 20:25 OMCA Board Meeting is winding down,

** 14:44 Finally got to this. Slept fairly well in spite of waking almost every hour to pee. 0047-0745, 6:12 83. Stayed pretty busy, getting coffee down, taking the carbamazipene, getting dressed and bird feeders out before leaving to meet Michael. We walked further than ever, came back home with over 8,500 steps logged, Had toast and the rest of the meds, then went to Giant and the library to pick up "Maid of Honor" for Valerie and Tegmark's "Our Mathematical Universe" for me. Got the Macbook ready to host Valerie's meeting, then joined mine. Valerie is off picking up a free bird feeder now. My new 3Tb drive arrived after lunch and I've just loaded it into the portable drive. Might get it formatting before I lie down for a bit.
** 16:47 It's formatted and I tried lying down. By then it was too late - Valerie came back and I was hungry, so I heated up some soup and did the dishes. Now she's napping and I'm shutting things down here and getting backups made in prep for installing the backup drive inside the box. Then I might get really ambitious and try getting backup, data and media all included in fstab, and if that all works out well I just might trim down the number of usb drives that I have plugged in at one time. And maybe find something else to do with the WDBOOK drive. Maybe. Anyway, should be back in an hour or thereabouts.
** 18:03 It's taking longer than that. Might be just me, but gparted is confusing me.
** 19:20 We seem to be working OK now - the new drive is formatted ext4 and named "backup" and it and data and media are all in the fstab and mounted with a "mount -a". It did load backup as owned by root - not sure why that keeps happening, but I chown and chgrp'd it and all's well. We'll see when I shut it down next time whether it continues to behave like that. Right now none of the usb drives are attached. I found a set of instructions "Installing my 3TB hard drive on Debian linux step by step" and followed it slavishly and it worked. Right now ~/media is copying to ~/backup/media. Seems to be copying pretty quickly. Just now see that I have several Windows 7 iso's, maybe time to let those go? And maybe time to fix dinner!
** 21:28 Spaghetti and wilted spinach. Copying data, media and now, the 20201201 data backup to the new drive. Might be time to watch British Baking, maybe not.

** 09:39 Got to bed and to sleep unusually late - not sure why - and forgot to take my evening meds. 0024-0802, 5:48 79. Back very stiff and painful at spine just below ribs. Tried the Giant 1/2 caffeine 100% - drinkable but not fun. Lay on hot pad for a while, put IcyHot on back and am dressed now. New drive is basically populated - backup of data and media plus both 20201201 tars from WDBOOK. WDBOOK is online and just now updated data.
** 13:27 I've updated the Minutes per my notes. Now to listen to the "tape" and finish the job. Distracted by other fiddly things so it may take me more than an hour, but that's the way I am.
** 14:04 Added a .gitignore to .emacs.d - magit doesn't seem to be happening as advertised, but I'm not yet sure that I understand it all. Oh, well, doing it in the terminal seems to work for me.
** 21:04 Attended the District 7 meeting - my first as GSR. Happily Valerie was incredulous that they were going to meet in person at Waterloo, so I checked again and found the Zoom info. Carl will update the website to make my mistake impossible in the future.
** 21:05 I give up. Even Sacha Chua has been using use-package for years and years. I'm going to have to get in line.
** 21:46 Made the first changes to init.el per Sacha Chua, gitted, and it seems to restart ok. 27 packages updated, three no longer needed. Wonder whether it'll make any difference?

** 09:53 Seem to have slept well: 0104-0818, 6:22 81. Back is still stiff as yesterday morning, maybe not quite as much, but close. It eased up yesterday, expect it will again today. Forecast to warm to upper 50s, so planning an afternoon outside - arranging the garden shed, washing windows, closing-up the gap in the work that Bob did, etc. This morning top priority is to get the Minutes done - i.e., listening to the tape.
** 10:12 Just bought "dasmith.xyz" - 2 years for $8.35. Thinking to use it for a local site - try dynamic dns, maybe? Justify that gigabit connection? So far it's just the domain plus a year of whois guard. If all else fails I can add it to daslearns.ca as an add-on and host it there. Or get a $5/mo cloud linux box to play with, and keep everything simpler and more at arms length. So, for now, just leave it at that, poop, get dressed, take the bird feeders out, and get started with the minutes.
** 11:25 Dressed, toasted, Vestry "tape" installed and date corrected with this string: touch -d "November 17 19:34:30" 20201117-vestry.WMA which worked like a charm so that I don't have to go through the acrobatics of resetting the date on the recorder every time I take the battery out. Good stuff! Just reset to the end time of each meeting when I get home and copy it to the proper directory on data.
** 21:16 Went to Lowes and Aldi - got foam board and aerosol foam, normal foodstuffs at Aldi. Foamed the openings (dryer vent and vent near the power/gas inlet). Removed the last of the window screens. We had pad thai and pie for supper. Watched the final Great British Baking Show and now Valerie is watching The Bridesmaids. I watched for a while and it didn't seem that fun.
** 22:08 Fiddled with init.el a bit, undid a lot of the changes.

** 10:35 Slept well: 0039-0858, 7:39 84. Stiff but not much sharp pain. Dressed, time to take the birds their goodies. Foggy but clearing. 5-8 inches of snow predicted on Wednesday, but said to make it to 61F today and sun this afternoon. Time to get things wrapped outside.
** 11:14 Birds taken care of, checked the S gutter and there was just a handfull of pine needles near but not in the downspout. Gone now, just need to check the long N gutter - the rest are all scoured clean and shiny. Those heavy rains were good for something! I see that Staples has a relatively inexpensive plastic box for hanging file folders. That's what I need for the next step in the saga of "War Story", so I should make that happen today. But first, into the crawl space to get the Christmas decorations up for Valerie.
** 12:22 Did the deed, not too bad a task, did cut a finger (note to self: wear gloves in the crawl space!). Want to go to Staples before beginning the insulation job outside.
** 13:49 Went to Staples, success, I think. A container, 25 hanging folders, 50 manilla folders. Can thus do late 1943 through 1944 into 1945, or thereabouts. No excuses now. Didn't make it to Giant, but it's beautiful, sunny and warm so I'll do the rest of the insulation trick and whatever else outside first.

** 00:00 Outside yesterday afternoon worked pretty well. I checked the last of the downspouts, the NE, it had some leaves and pine needles next to the downspout, which I cleaned out. I cut the foam to finish making the insulation for under Valerie's studio floor, and glued the uprights together and left them in the carport under weights to cure. Today I'll finish assembling them and insert them, maybe get the cover in place and painted. Valerie did some planting and gave some corms to John. I also hung the trap up on the wall in the shed, and saw how the screens can easily be hung from the carport roof out of danger. Should probably plan on painting the 2x4s before I hang them. After I came in I sorted some of the letters from 1944 into hanging folders. Valerie made Costa Rican rice and beans, and we had that and salmon for dinner. We talked for two hours with Adriana starting at 8:30. It's almost ten after midnight and time to go to bed.
** 09:37 Slept well: 0040-0811, 6:54 87, just now BP 135/89. Valerie got up when I did and went back to bed. Another beautiful late fall day - 49 just now, some light rain around 10:30 last night. The foam seems to have stuck together, so that can get finished today. Very stiff again - 3-4 days in a row. I'm really going to have to get into some regular stretching and exercising in addition to just walking.
** 11:27 Valerie woke about an hour ago. Said that she had a terrible night, which I totally missed. Choking among other things, while fitbit said she did fine. Hmmm. Going to try using a single Emacs window split vertically to start with mu4e and org-journal. We'll see how that goes.
** 11:30 Right monitor is now a single Emacs window with two buffers split vertically. This is currently in the R buffer. I think I have a function that will move between visible buffers with the arrow keys, but don't remember just now. For now I'll just us C-x o.
** 11:32 Some of the minor functions are a bit odd - when I M-x in the other buffer, this buffer went totally into the "options for M-x (helm?)" instead of it only displaying at the bottom of the active buffer, and then after I started mu4e, I ran U to update and the mini-buffer was full-width. Not at all sure that I like working this way just now. Might change my mind later, might be just as happy looking into the Debian of xfce documentation for how to move from window to window with the keyboard and keep separate Emacs windows. For now, I'm going back to starting with an instance for mu4e, one for org-journal and etc., and when I open text files from Thunar yet another. It seems to work just fine for now.
** 11:41 Back again. Awfully close to noon, may be time to get into the grungies and finish the insulation gig.
** 14:32 Took some adjustments - once again I didn't measure twice (or at least often enough) before cutting, but the insulation is all in place and the cover plate is painted. Just need to attach the plate and tidy up everything and that will be done. Valerie (with a little help) got the fuse in the icycle lights that she put on the front railing of the deck, so that lights up now, so we're somewhat festive (even though we just don't feel it that much). I'll make a snack and finish up outside.
** 17:43 It's done. Had a lie-down beginning at 1530 and ending a little while ago when Mim and Adam came to the door. We had a visit, then I took the compost out to the bin, brought the bird feeders in, and here we are. Valerie had a long talk with Ans, and is feeling down now.
** 23:31 Watched some good YouTube-about historic costumes. Good presenter. Valerie is going to start reading Quicksilver again. I'm sleepy and about to give up. Copying Calibre library to thumb drive to update the one on Macguinnes.

** 09:51 Sponge went into the oven to prove about a half-hour ago. Got dishes done from making beans and rice the other night. Now for a second cuppa and a poop before mixing it up into a lump o' dough.
** 13:41 Bread is rising in pans, Jill texted a while ago reminding me that it's my night to get a speaker for the 11th-12th traditions. A moment of panic, then I texted Joe Nietz. He's come through like a prince. Bless his heart. 8 minutes left on the timer.
** 13:59 Bread is in the oven! I'll start working on the Apple Crisp in 20 minutes or so.
** 15:05 Bread is out of the oven and looks great. Apples for the crisp are peeled and cut. Valerie is working on the rest.
** 23:55 Supper was same as last night, plus a salad. Apple crisp was better than nice. Excellent meeting with Joe N. Tried to send PayPal to Jesse - they wouldn't accept his address, so I sent it to Jackie, and she'd had trouble with PayPal. Looks like she's able to get in now, so fingers crossed. $460 for Spring Semester tuition. Cereal and bed now.

** 10:08 Slept well: 0048-0907, 7:33 87. A moderately busy day - library, christmas cards, Ben, haircut and vestry. Valerie has some things for me to get at Giant when I go to the library shortly.
** 12:24 Shopping worked pretty well - got the book at the library, found everything at Giant, and finally located the Steven King books that Finn wants. Removed helm from emacs, at least for the time being. It ultimately was more trouble than anything that it added. Removed the "halls of macadamia" site from elfeed - too much whining, not enough information.
** 13:43 Talked with Ben - all good - again 01/12/2021 1100. Haircut at 1500.
** 17:36 Hair cut, showered, ready to head out to Vestry. Later.
** 22:42 Vestry went well, easy drive both ways, got gas, pleasant meeting just under an hour. Valerie had prepared a Dutch meal - potatos, sausage, saurkraut and hunt sauce. Delicious. Hurt her back pretty badly though. She's watching TV, I'm going through reading and etc.
** 23:25 Enough. To bed.

** 10:40 Woke at 0811 and realized that I'm meeting Michael at 0900. Slept well, 0050-0811, 6:47 86. Walk went well, suggested that the news industry is based on keeping up agitated, and that isn't a good thing for alcoholics, and maybe he should focus more on reading and a hobby. Not that I shouldn't listen to my own advice. The least little bits of snow began right about 1000 as predicted, and we both headed home. Today we finish the Christmas cards, host the noon Al-Anon meeting, and I'm not sure what else.
** 14:29 Meetings done, addresses for Christmas cards collected, or in the case of Nancy's girls and Patty, requested. Google contact info updated. Valerie is down for a nap. Snow has stopped for the moment - I'll bundle up and get mail and brush snow off the bird feeders. They've been popular today!
** 21:21 Got ambitious and am building the latest Emacs. With any luck we'll be back soon.
** 21:44 Seems to start OK - first opened emacsnotes.org and updated the installed version to 27.1.50, and saving then trying to open journal did some weird things, but it may be a result of my not really knowing org commands yet. Helm seems to be in-and-out, so it might be worth diving in and removing the Customize reference to helm. Fingers crossed!
** 21:56 I took out the '(package-selected-packages entries for helm-descbinds and helm between smart-mode-line and auto-compile. I imagine if I uncomment the helm entries (or uncomment them a few at a time instead of jumping in with all of SC's suggestions) they'll be added back in there. At any rate, it didn't totally break. However the odd stuff when I Mx- something is still there. I'm not sure that I really think of it as help. Maybe it's

** 09:00 Slept, but not all that well. 0126-0751, 5:29 74. First morning starting up Emacs 27 with all the (ill-advised) config changes that I absorbed (all at once, the ill-advised part) from Sacha Chua. Startup is now noticably slow, with auto-compile, waiting for git (2 times) smart-mode-line, recentf, and some deprecated date definitions in templates (org-roam?). I wonder whether, with the changes that were made to 27, and with my increased experience with Emacs, whether it would be worth once again starting with a blank init.el and building it up? Ask myself some questions like, mainly, do I want to write mainly in md or org? I do like mu4e and org-journal, that's for sure, so that's going to stay. What else? Anyway, time to get dressed, get birdseed outside and figure out what the outdoors is like. See you in a bit.
** 13:34 It's taken a while, both starting over in init.el and getting busy helping Valerie make Nanaimo Bar. Still working around this - it's looking more and more like the old one that I had, just without helm and some other (I think) ideosynchratic SC items. Plus the text colors are problematic by default. Certainly here in org-journal - brownish orange on a white background! Might have to either go back to the old installation, or add a theme here. Also will want to try different epub modes. But at least it's still working. And now that I've added the org-mode entries I get the "cl is deprecated" warning. But at least the really slow start with the auto-compile messages hasn't returned.
** 14:12 Reverting to the original .emacs.d - tried to roll-back with git but while I got all the right messages, init.el didn't change. I've commented-out helm, org-roam and most other SC changes. I'm intending to restore ido-mode and maybe remove the custom colors and try using themes - I'm not sure that the dead black background is working that well.
** 15:51 Things seem fairly stable now, behaving as expected (i.e., I've undone the damage done a few days ago when I started reading Sacha Chua's config file). Still getting the "Package cl is deprecated" but I have to assume that it's code in one of the loaded packages and not anything directly in my init.el. I may be proven wrong, but so far nothing's broken.
** 17:02 
** 17:04 Installed the modus themes and activated the light theme, modus-operandi. I'll probably want to enlarge the default font size some - two points at least. Backdrop seems to be pure white, this text is a reddish brown (or brownish red).
** 17:20 Enlarged the default font, maybe a hair too much (120) - I'll drop it down to 115 and try again.
** 17:23 Much better - both windows fit on the right monitor and the font is readable. Now to load a few files and see how they look (and which font face they choose).
** 17:25 Well, the markdown option is the serif, which is the Right Thing.
** 17:35 Brought the bird feeders in - they cleaned-out the cutworms today. Very clear, should be a cold night. Just tried the f5 to change themes from light to dark - works just fine.
** 17:55 Actually the markdown option is fixed, and can be switched to variable by Mx variable-pitch-mode. As of now I don't know how to then change it back to default or fixed font.
** 19:10 Added an early-init.el to .emacs.d right after dinner. There will be a very short RAC tonight - only one app and it's a no-brainer - a fence behind a townhome.
** 20:27 We ended up tabeling the fence - no plan, no sample. Should be quick next meeting.
