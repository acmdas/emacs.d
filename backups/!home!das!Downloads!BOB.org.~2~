Many Shades of BOB* – by Doug Irvin – According To Hoyt

** The Absolute Minimalist BOB

To assemble it you will need: Several quart sized and one gallon sized Ziplock type bags.

A lighter.

One flattened roll of toilet paper with the cardboard tube removed. Once flattened, place in appropriate ziplock bag, squeeze out all the air and close Ziplock bag.

A pocketknife, preferably a Leatherman Supertool or something similar that is high quality.

Five Maxipads. They are very absorbent and sterile, so they can be used as pressure bandages in case of an accident. Put in Ziplock and squeeze out the air.

2 pint bottles of water. (optional).

2 or 3 power bars. If you can, get the horrible kind like they put in military combat rations, the dreaded MRE

A flashlight in a ziplock bag with at least 2 extra batteries.

Take the stuff and put it into the gallon ziploc bag. Express the air and zip it shut. You can then take the second bag, place the full bag into the second so that the zipped portion is put in first, express the air, and zip the second one shut. This will provide a lot of moisture protection.

** The Basic BOB

The Basic BOB is meant to be carried every day, and is geared towards an urban or suburban environment. This is something that, since it is meant for everyday carry, must be comfortable, rugged, and useful in daily life.

The bag itself. We suggest something inconspicuous and easy to carry, but with an appreciable load capacity. A medium sized briefcase will suffice, but try to get a North Face or Jansport type bag that college students use as book bags. The bags will have extra external and internal pockets which will come in handy for little things you need to get to quickly such as toilet paper or food. The bags often come with Fastex buckles which allow the bearer to externally attach other items allowing the user to customize his carry.

A Leatherman Supertool or something similar

Spare glasses.

One roll of toilet paper.

A multifuel lighter (zippo-type) or an unopened drug store butane lighter.

Food. Have some power bars or some cookies. The best way to figure your needs is to miss lunch, then see if one or two packs of Oreos or a power bar or two takes most of the edge off. The prepackaged cheese and crackers snacks for kids are a good idea also. Plan on a 48 hour period of relying on your BOB. Have six very small meals, each in its own ziplock bag. Eat them once a month and restock so they don’t go bad on you.

Water. Have a minimum of 4 20 ounce bottles.

Medicine. Be absolutely certain you have any daily meds you take.

Space blanket.

Toothbrush and toothpaste.

Money. A spare $100.00, a roll of quarters for vending machines.

Spare clothing. At least spare socks in a ziplock bag.

Personal protection. Get the strongest pepper spray you can find and rotate stock every six months.

Firearm.

Maxipads.

Pencil and paper.

Band-Aids.

Radio and batteries.

A flashlight.

A respirator.

Soap.

A fork and a spoon.

** Intermediate BOB

Now we move on to something a little more substantial. Since cold weather is the most difficult thing to deal with, this section is geared towards people who travel in rural areas and who may experience unpleasant winters. This is a BOB you will fill and put into your vehicle, opening it only to rotate stocks every so often or if you need it.

The bag itself should be larger. We suggest a medium sized rucksack with or without a frame. An internally framed ruck is better, but it is not necessary. A cheap solution is a medium sized military issue ALICE rucksack. ALICE stands for All purpose Light weight Individual Carrying Equipment. Leave it to the military to come up with a 7 word name for rucksack and then an acronym to shorten it. The ALICE ruck’s design was employed in numerous conflicts and to the best of my knowledge no one ever complained about the rucksack except to say the frame was somewhat flimsy. The frame is aluminum, and will bend if abused by being sat upon or in some other fashion. If it is used in its intended fashion, it will last a lifetime with no care at all. Read some reviews on the ALICE here-www.trailspace.com/gear/review/00002483

Another alternative is a gym bag of tough construction, preferably with 4 or 5 external pockets. Several sporting goods places on the web offer “range bags” or “shooter’s bags” that are made of very strong stuff and have many external pockets. Get one with good sewn in handles and, if possible, end handles as well as the standard top handles. Good quality gym bags can be found at most retail outlets like Wal-Mart.

If you drive a truck with no back seat, try to get a gym bag with a bottom width the same as the floor with the seat moved to the rear. If you have to put the bag in the back of the truck, try to avoid putting water in the bag as it will freeze and burst the container.

Consider this list a continuation of the basic BOB:

Clothes. Put in a spare set of jeans, a shirt, socks, spare boots or athletic shoes, a scarf, a balaclava or a ski mask, good gloves, a lightweight waterproof parka or windbreaker, and some long underwear. Put them separately into plastic bags and seal them as best you can. That which will fit into a ziplock, put into a ziplock. As always, get the air out of the bag before sealing.

Fatty, salty, and sugary foods. Get a can or two of Spam, yes Spam. I said Spam and throw it in there. A can or two of Dinty Moore stew should go in there as well as junk food like chocolate chip cookies, etc. A good rule of thumb is if your kids whine for it, you will want to carry a little of it for any potential on foot impromptu camping trip.

Get also a few packets of dried noodle soups like Hot Ramen or Cup A Soup so that you can drink stuff to warm up. Hot chocolate packets and instant coffee is also recommended. The General Foods International coffees are about half sugar and come in a sturdy tin, but beware, after drinking a cup you may feel compelled to start talking about your feelings. When the temperature drops and you have to walk through snow and ice you need to eat and drink horrible crap like that. The drinks and noodles will warm you, fat will feed you, and the salt will constipate you. Constipation is good because who wants to stick their derriere out and squat in 10F weather?

A small pot. Get a 2 quart, preferably iron, pot for melting snow or heating water for drinking or making soup.If you feel that a 2 quart pot is too much to carry, there are alternatives. One may choose to go with aluminum cookware, but it may be damaged or crushed if abused in some fashion. It may also make your food taste nasty and is unhealthy from a long term perspective. Another suggestion is titanium cookware which will only crush your wallet.

Get a small camper stove. This is optional. They are simple inexpensive affairs of flat stamped metal that you can build a small fire under and put a pot on. Alternately you can have a small propane stove with a cylinder of gas.

Maps. Don’t forget the map if you have to ditch your vehicle. Try to avoid going out without one. You will want that piece of paper if you are unfamiliar with the area, and you will want it if you are. Things look different at 3 miles an hour, land marks won’t pass with that familiar tempo.

A tent. Get a small inexpensive pop up tent and put it in your bag. A $20.00 USD tent will be more than enough to keep the wind off of three huddled people, which can be the difference between life and death in a nasty winter storm, especially if wet.

Candles. Get two or three emergency candles. You would not believe the amount of heat these things throw off in a confined space. Try it out. Get in the tent sometime, seal it up, and light a candle. You should have to start taking off clothes within 10 to 15 minutes. A note about clothes. If you are cold with your clothes on, try taking some off or opening them up. The cold may just be there because your sweat can’t get away from you. Dry is warm and warm is dry.

Sleeping bag. Get a decent bag. Try to get one that goes into a “stuff bag”. They compact the best and are easiest to carry.

Poncho. Get an army surplus or, better yet, a new poncho. We wouldn’t advise wearing one because they will make you sweat, which will make you cold, but they are great to rest a tent on. Also, they make a great hasty tent or sleeping bag. You can find quality stuff at http://www.rangerjoes.com (http://www.rangerjoes.com).

GPS and a compass. This is most likely unnecessary except in a blizzard, but hey, be prepared. Get a moderately priced GPS with preprogrammable waypoints and an expensive compass. Preprogram your waypoints along your most traveled routes. Never be lost again, right?

Spare fuel. There are emergency fuel packs sold in Wal Mart, K Mart, Auto Zone, etc. These are “trunk safe” containers of mineral spirits that can be used in a pinch if you run out of gas. One or two is a good idea. If you have a diesel, cooking oil can serve as an emergency fuel, so keep a couple of gallons of vegetable oil in your vehicle.

A small can of red spray paint. This is optional. If you need to mark your way whether by marking trees or by leaving a directional arrow in the snow, have this item.

Water. If it is snowy, you have water. If it isn’t you need at least three 20oz bottles per day. Figure to have on hand a 3 day supply. Gatorade is better, but have something to drink.

A charcoal hand warmer. These can be found at sporting goods shops. Have one and extra fuel. Store them in ziplock bags. This item can be the difference between losing and keeping digits in a frostbite situation. If you can, get two so you can warm your hands and feet at the same time.

Personal protection. I know I am repeating myself here. Carry pepper spray. There are bad people in the world and you don’t want to get to know them. There are good people on the road, but that’s not the expectation you should use.

Firearms. Get a quality pistol and get good with it. Stick it in your parka pocket and zip it shut when you walk. If you have it on a holster it might show and people might not slow to help you. It will also be more difficult to get to under a parka. If it is in the pocket you can keep your hand in there and no one will notice. They will assume you are just cold. Make certain you zip of button you pocket when you walk as to prevent your weapon from falling out.

** Advanced BOB

Oh dear, it finally happened. Some jackass nuked half a dozen major cities simultaneously, the food and petroleum supply has been disrupted, there is a plague that makes the Black Death look like a head cold and we can’t fight it, or Mike Tyson is in an elevator with you. Whatever it may be, it is time to haul ass in a big way, and you have a long way to go. This isn’t just getting home due to a bad hair day, this is Bosnia for a Croat or Rwanda for a Hutu time. It is time to “Run Forrest, run!” or “Run Luke, run!” depending on how grandiose your self image is.

When you go you know that travel may be uncertain. There may be roadblocks as is routine in rural Africa when there is one of their periodic disease outbreaks, there may be civil unrest like the Rodney King riots, there may be martial law declared so you can’t use the roads. Any way you slice it you have to maximize the chances of getting yourself and your family safely to safety, and this may involve transition from wheels to feet in order to get there.

Before you can even consider this level of planning you need to consider the goal. If you wish to go to Grandma’s farm 300 miles away, you need not one plan, or two plans, you need several alternates. What takes 5 hours by highway may take weeks with a family in tow on foot. Write down the plans in a notebook and have the appropriate maps. If you catch some Apache’s arrow, the rest of the family will still need to make it there if they can.

Consider the size of your family and their ages. This will be a major indicator of what needs to happen with regards to provisions.

Never try to carry any more than 50-60 pounds per healthy adult male, and never try to go 25-35 pounds per woman or teen.

Always plan for the worst. If you have 3 kids and a wife make every plan as though it would be made over land without roads and carrying at least one member. Figure that if you can go 15 miles a day with a family on foot, you are really doing well, so 300 miles equals a minimum of 20 days of travel, with a realistic expectation being 30 days. And an angry, dirty, whining, X Box withdrawal group of unhappy campers they will be.

This list is a continuation of the above BOB lists. The first two lists were just for a single person. Do the math.

Multiply where you need to, more tents, ponchos, etc. Figure a roll of toilet paper lasts an adult male a week when he eats regularly, so multiply rolls times people times weeks. Family of five going 300 miles? 5 people X 4 weeks is twenty rolls of paper, which is a lot of volume, so everyone carries their own TP in their personal ruck. Another thing, get the roughest TP you can get. It wipes off the poop better, it stores better, and the women won’t use as much.

The bag or bags. Go to a dive store, that is a place SCUBA divers shop, not a store with cheap beer and cheaper women. Get one of the large dive bags they sell. These bags are designed to hold heavy and bulky stuff in harsh environments and are extremely rugged. Don’t forget to buy individual rucks for those who don’t have them. They make good book bags for kids, so tell them that is what they will use them for. It will get them used to carrying them.

A shovel. You will need to bury your poop and scrape a fire pit. You may also need to bury someone. If you have to bury someone, mark the location in your GPS. It may be important for you to return later. Bring at least a military issue entrenching tool. They are small, inexpensive, light, and they collapse.

A water filter. You cannot expect your wife or kids to drink ditch water. Get a reverse osmosis filtration pump with an iodide filter. An inexpensive backup that you must have is regular household bleach. 3 to 4 drops per gallon is all that is needed to make water safe for consumption, so get a small medicine dropper and fill it with bleach. Add the bleach to the water, stir or shake vigorously, and let it sit for an hour. It will then be drinkable. Try to avoid ingesting any sediment.

Binoculars. Have at least one pair. You may have a need to look at things at a distance. Don’t go cheap on binos, this is one area where expensive is good.

A wagon. Go to Lehman’s online catalogue or go to Lowes or Home Depot, etc. They will have very sturdy wooden wagons or metal garden wagons. The metal garden wagons typically have better handles, better wheels, better suspensions, and carry more, but they can be uncomfortable to touch in winter and they can rust. If you have to put an infant in one, you don’t want there to be a chance of instant frostbite just because he was fussy and flailing around. The suggestion is to go with wood. You can order a Lehman’s wagon with very large wheels for off road use. If you have small children who may need to be pulled, get two wagons. One wagon is for provisions and

the other to carry rug rats. http://www.LEHMANS.com&nbsp (http://www.LEHMANS.com&nbsp); These wagons

can carry two or three hundred pounds easily, so these are not your old Radio Flyer.

Food. Half a cup of dried rice is equal to roughly 1 ½ cups of cooked rice. That is a lot of rice per person, so no one should be very hungry. Figure a family of five eating twice a day is five cups a day times thirty days travel is 150 cups of rice.

With 16 cups per gallon two 5 gallon containers should suffice for a month’s travel. Get PVC buckets with pour spout lids.

Beans. Rice and beans twice a day for a month will cool ardor and may lead to acts of violence, but you will be pleased to see that they have plenty of energy to argue, since rice and beans will provide almost all the nutrients a body needs.

The question is, “How much of beans do we carry?” If you plan on canned beans figure 60 eight to twelve ounce cans. If you get dried beans, figure ¾ a cup dried volume per meal, or a little over 3 gallons of dried beans. The drawback to dried beans is that they have to be soaked for 24 hours, so you will have to start soaking beans 24

hours in advance of each meal which is a pain.

While dried beans are better in the long run because the excess can be planted at your destination come warm weather, you may wish to opt for canned.

Fat. Get a two gallon jug of Crisco. You will need it in order to cook wild game which is always extremely lean meat. You may wish to get a three pound block of lard instead. Lard would actually be better since it is a solid and can’t leak. It also tastes better, and takes up less space.

Many Shades of BOB* – by Doug Irvin – According To Hoyt

Salt. Carry a pound box of iodized salt. You will use it at your destination or for barter. Ever wonder where salt comes from? It most likely isn’t a local product. You will be sweating a lot on this trip, so you will need salt.

Meat. This will be provided by Mother Nature. Do you know the Iroquois word for bad hunter? Vegetarian.

Cookware. Bring a metal measuring cup. You need to measure that rice. Bring a cast iron skillet and a cast iron 2

quart pan with a lid. Get a metal serving spoon and a metal spatula. That should take care of all your cooking utensil needs.

An axe. Never be without a good axe. Get one with a hammer side if you can.

Soap. Carry a few bars. You need to bathe once a week, and daily hand washing is very important. Try to stock anti-bacterial if at all possible. Don’t carry liquid soap as it is heavier and can spill.

Radio. Get a hand powered radio. They will pick up shortwave, weather stations, AM, and FM stations. They don’t take batteries, so that is one more thing you won’t have to bring. Also consider getting some walkie-talkies. Have extra rechargable batteries and keep them charged.

Insect repellent. Get some suitable repellants for the older people and for any infants. You can’t use high concentrations of DEET on infants and toddlers because it can cause skin irritation and seizures. Remember, spray it on your hand and wipe it on the kid, don’t spray it on them.

Fishing tackle. You can make a fishing rig out of a bean can or a Coke can, some monofilament line, a float, and a hook. Fishing rods can get broken, so unless you are one of the lucky few with a Pocket Fisherman, you will have to improvise. They are available on Amazon.

Hammock. Get a cheap fishnet hammock for every member of your party except the littlest ones. The hammocks will serve as hammocks, naturally. They will also serve as a hasty stretcher and as a hasty fishnet with the use of saplings cut for poles. You can simplify putting them up and taking them down by tying a heavy duty D ring on the end ropes. You just wind the line around the tree trunk a few times and snap the D ring onto the rope to secure it.

They are cheap and will roll up into a ball the size of a man’s fist. They fit easily into a small ziplock for carrying.

Rope. Get about 20 or 30 feet of stout ½ or ¾ inch rope. You may need it to pull the wagons or for some other unforeseen purpose. Learn some knots. A ready source (and free!) Is A. Hyatt Verrill’s Knots, Splices and Rope Work, on gutenberg.org. If your Bug Out is by water, his “The Book of the Sailboat: How to rig, sail and handle small boats” might be handy. But regardless, knowing a handful of useful knots will always be helpful. A couple of hundred feet of paracord will always be useful. An older copy of The Boy Scout Handbook would be handy.

Firearms. Have a .22LR rifle at the very least. It isn’t much of a self defense weapon, but it will kill rabbits and squirrels. A 12GA shotgun is also strongly recommended with a variety of loads. A centerfire rifle is even more strongly recommended. Every able bodied member should bear a long arm on the trip, even if they don’t know how to use it. If you carry some slugs, some #1 buckshot, and some #6 shot, you can take deer as well as small game.

Again, firearms are a very personal choice, so make yours wisely, and get some training.

Personal bags. Each person who can carry one should have a backpack of some sort. In addition to toilet paper, let them put whatever they want into it without comment when you leave, they will need that psychologically.

Medicine. Over the counter meds are strongly recommended if you have needed them in the past. Also make sure you get some Imodium for the treatment of diarrhea. Diarrhea can be fatal in kids. Children’s vitamins are also a good idea if they are already taking them.

Many Shades of BOB* – by Doug Irvin – According To Hoyt

A sewing kit. A good all purpose emergency sewing kit will weigh only a few ounces and take up less space than a pack of cards. It is good not only for suturing clothes, but skin as well in a pinch. Get one and a few extra buttons.

Gas mask. A gas mask, better called a protective mask, may be something an individual may consider not carrying at all. Protective masks are good for filtering out nuclear, biological, and chemical threats.

Lets talk about the three NBC scenarios.

Nuclear

They work best against a nuclear threat where they will act to keep radioactive dust out of your lungs. Since an area that has been bombed will lose most of its danger due to fallout in days, hours if there is a strong rain, this mask will be of limited usefulness. In fact, this degree of protection can be approxamated by breathing through a wet rag, and an almost identical degree of protection can be given by a cannister type painter’s mask. A promaks is a good thing to have in this instance, but the remotenet possibility of an nuclear attack along with the extremely remopte chance of your encountering it may not justify the purchase of this item.

Chemical

Chemical warfare agents are difficult to make, transport, and employ. They just plain old don’t work very well, and as a result it is almost an impossibility that even soldiers in a combat zone will ever encounter them much less a civilian.. A good quality mask will protect you from inhalation of toxic fumes for several hours to several days.

Biological

In the event of a natural or man made plague a quality pro mask will provide excellent protection. Virises cannot easily pass through, bacteria certainly cannot at all. The problem here is that most likely by the time you discover there is a danger of infection, it is too late to don your pro mask.

The problem with pro masks is that they provide temporary protection. You can’t live in one, so you must leave the area. Another problem is that if you have a family you may be able to protect your adult and young adult members, but infants can only be protected by “Gas Tents” that use battery powered filtrations systems, and retail for several hundred dollars each.

A good source for these items is http://www.APPROVEDGASMASKS.com

(http://www.APPROVEDGASMASKS.com). This is another place where expensive most likely means good

quality. Don’t skimp if you buy one of these, it is a false economy.

Our bug out bags are the last line of defense after everything else. They are prepositioned in the truck. On the refrigerator we have a 5 minute list a 15 minute list and a 1 hour list.

The 5 minute list is basically to dump all medicines/ jewelry box / top shelf of safe in two garbage bags and https://accordingtohoyt.com/2021/02/15/many-shades-of-bob-by-doug-irvin/

GO.

The hour list gets to turning off water and pouring antifreeze in the traps on exit if coming back is a possibility.

I have a hospital bug out bag and I’ve stockpiled certain food for a three day emergency. It is harder to get medication. I won’t be able to leave because I need the dialysis supplies in my apartment to survive. But I might make a smaller Bob to put in my car– I always carry small bottles of water in the car (warm water is drinkable) because I live in a desert. You should always carry water.

My 2 cents about firearms (and any other weapons for that matter.) If you don’t know, or don’t think you can pull the trigger to kill someone, don’t get it. Otherwise it will be used against you and other people after you’re dead.

Know when to use it. If you can safely leave the area, do so. If brandishing the weapon gets them to leave you alone, do it. Otherwise, if the person is coming at you with a weapon raised or pointed at you, you are a free to kill them. Verbally warn them off if you have the luxury of doing so. Who knows, they might stop.

If the person is bigger than you are, and threatening bodily harm, you are free to shoot them; especially if you’re a woman. Guys, it sucks to be us in a court room. If you think you’re going to get hurt or killed, then shoot, and take your chances.

If you have multiple assailants, doesn’t matter if they’re armed or not, if they’re threatening harm, like closing in for the kill and not just spouting off, shoot to kill. Don’t get fancy, take the closest ones out first, center of mass.

If you’re in a bug out situation, then it’s assumed that the SHTF and police protection has broken down. Shoot, and go. Don’t worry about it.

If this is a singular crime situation (house break-in, mugging, attempted rape, kidnapping), that changes. If the person you shot is still alive, call the ambulance, then call the police, and then call your lawyer. Call your insurance agency too, and if you have firearms insurance, call them.

I would like to add that if you own a firearm of any kind, it’s a very good idea (as in, it’s rather dumb not to) take the time to learn what the firearms laws are in your area. If your bug out plan takes you out of your area (as in the sample Grandma’s house 300 miles away), also research the firearms laws at your destination and every where in between. It’s much (but not completely) better down here in Florida now that we have preemption, but at one time here in Florida just driving a few miles in any given direction could mean going from being a law abiding citizen to a Felon. Note that “but not completely”. What we’ve found is that even with preemption, and even with more recent Florida law supposedly giving preemption some teeth, there are still jurisdictions that have their own laws (cities, counties, etc.) and just because those laws are technically not valid, that doesn’t mean you won’t get arrested and have to defend yourself in court.

In a complete breakdown scenario, most of the above doesn’t apply. However, the few times that “bugging out” was a possibility, it was due to political unrest – Rodney King Riots, Potential for race riots due to Martin/Zimmerman thing, 2020 (enough said) – the rule of law hadn’t broken down completely, so I would have needed to be careful not to bug-out from the frying pan, only to jump into the legal fire.

Doug, thanks for taking the time to put this together. I have never needed my BOB, but there have been a number of times it’s presence has helped with my peace of mind. On the other hand, there have been a number of times that the BOB in my trunk has been raided for non-emergency reasons (kid getting a cut while at the park (bandaids), friend’s angry wife having a headache at an event (aspirin), a friend “freezing”

and being very appreciative of the spare sweater I always have in the BOB (even though I live in Florida) etc. Always replaced asap, of course

Oh, and a note for those of you who are laughing at the idea of a BOB. Look again at my previous paragraph. You wouldn’t believe how often that bag saved the day in some minor way. Maybe you won’t ever have to leave your home. Frankly, plan A for me is to shelter in place regardless. BUT when something unexpected pops up, it’s great to have good ol’ BOB around.

I’m using a printed version of this post as a checklist, guide, and reference. Most excellent.

I think the most important thing of all is mindset: game out/role play the situation. Make the hard decisions now–can I kill another human being if I have to? Yep, and I’ve got several ways to do it. But I’ve already made that hard decision.

I’ve got bags close, in the car, and in the storage. As time goes on I’m pulling everything where I can touch it because I can’t count on electronic gates working. I can’t count on anything working.

What I can count on is my Creator, my wits, and the malevolence of human nature.

Here’s something I posted a while back, elsewhere:

Make up some bags – small “school backpacks” would be best – and make each kid responsible for one. It gives them something to do and look out for as opposed to trailing along like baby ducks.

Bring a deck of cards, print out some rules for card games, and put them in with the rest of your stuff. There are also (or used to be) “travel games” of various sorts; metal or plastic markers with boards that doubled as storage containers. Most of them were about half the size of a paperback book and weighed almost nothing. They were popular with airline travelers as late as the 1960s.

If possible, don’t put all of something in only one bag, just in case the bag gets lost, stolen, or “confiscated.”

I’d also get a metal or wood “walking stick” for each family member. Besides being something to lean on when they’re tired, they’re good for pushing away inquisitive animals, poking things to see if they bite, seeing how deep that puddle is, etc. Lots of uses for a stick, particularly if you have some paracord on hand, and remarkably hard to find a useful one in urban or suburban areas. If parental sticks are stout enough they could serve as stretcher or travois poles as well.

Many Shades of BOB* – by Doug Irvin – According To Hoyt

We have scanned copies of all our important papers, including medical records (always get them after a doctor visit), and insurance policies. No, a scanned copy of your policy isn’t a legal document, but if you wind up far away from home, at least it gives a different agent information they might need to start your claim, depending on what kind of renter or homeowner policy you might have. (and read those policies – some of them cover more than you might expect!) We have a thumbdrive *and* a CD in each bag… and they also have copies of our address books, phone numbers, account numbers, and so forth. Note: if you encrypt the data, you should put a copy of the decrypt program on the medium, with versions for each major operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).

You should have copies of birth certificates, adoption papers, legal guardianship papers, or whatever you have on your children, particularly if they’re from a previous marriage. The way things are getting now, it’s not beyond the realm of possibility some overzealous official might decide you’re some kind of child abductor.

Each child should also have a set of papers of their own, in a waterproof container (a Ziplock is enough) saying who they are, who their parents are, and preferably the name and contact information of someone NOT in your local area to whom you’ve assigned “medical power of attorney” if you and your wife aren’t there or able to deal with a sick child. Most hospital admission desks will have clerks and pre-printed forms they’ll give you without charge. Put the kids’ IDs in those little hiker pouches that go around their neck on a string or chain. You might also see about appointing a guardian if you and your wife are killed or otherwise indisposed; for that, you might want paid-for legal advice, since how that works varies considerably across jurisdictions.

A multi-tool of some sort in *each* bag; preferably no two alike. Each tool seems to have one specific thing it does well. They make some small child-size tools as well. If you normally carry a blade anyway, break or grind off the ones on your multi-tool. If you wind up being “helped” by authorities, they’ll probably confiscate anything that has an edge. Even without a blade, there are plenty of uses for a tool.

If your family has more than one phone, turn all of them except yours OFF to conserve charge, and turn that one off when you’re not actually using it for something. If they use SIM cards, move the card from phone to phone as they run down.

And if you can, *practice*. Take the family to some hiking trails every now and then, work your way up until it’s not a big deal.

Tape. Duct tape at the least, Gaffer tape is better. Pull it off the roll and make a few small flats the size of a credit card. or go slightly bigger and carry them in a pocket. make several and stash them in with various other items. Rolls of electrical tape are also a good idea and both work well in first aid situations. More than once TP

and Electrical tape were my bandages, and once it was the gaffer tape I keep in my pocket.

I completely understand the BOB concept; but for those like myself who are pretty much buried in the middle of “civilization” (too far to drive to escape our fellow-travelers), above the 500y flood plain, don’t know where to bug out, and too old or crippled to survive for long on our own anyway, I recommend having a decent supply of essentials as above, stored in at least two places in the home (in case of theft or damage), and a well-read Bible (start now, if you haven’t already). Sure, we may need to move; but God *will* provide.

Many Shades of BOB* – by Doug Irvin – According To Hoyt

For those believers who might be upset by current events, I have two addition recommendations: 1. Read Psalm 91, in fact pray Psalm 91 about yourself and your loved ones. It’s not a magic charm and God’s plans may differ from ours; but it helps put things in perspective.

2. Memorize John 16:33, Hebrews 13:5-6, and James 1:12.

As Sarah often says, we win, they lose. So don’t give in to the “long defeat” way of thinking. We’re supposed to be fruit-flavored (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control in the ESV).
