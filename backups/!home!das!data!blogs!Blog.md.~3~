A little of this, some of that...

## Presidential Power
Posted on March 20, 2011 by David

The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. — Senator Barak Obama, December 20, 2007.

## Save the World
Posted on March 16, 2011 by David

The best way for America to save the world is to get rich, stay that way, and show how that is done. We can send help sometimes and privately we can send a lot. But we are not good at the empire business. — Jerry Pournelle

## Titanic
Posted on March 14, 2011 by David

Insolvency is no longer a sporadic problem, it’s become pervasive at all levels of government everywhere. This is why the recent brouhaha in Wisconsin was so surreal. The public-employee unions weren’t just rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking Titanic, they were fighting to preserve their right to bore more holes in the hull.—Eric S. Raymond

## Democracy
Posted on March 11, 2011 by David

It’s not democracy when citizens lose control over the pay and benefits of the people who work for them. It’s not progressive when employee compensation takes finite resources away from Medicaid, parks, roads and libraries. And it’s not collective bargaining when union representatives sit on both sides of the table. — Charles Lane at The Washington Post

## Normal
Posted on February 28, 2011 by David

Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that’s invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things. — Douglas Adams, “The Salmon of Doubt”

## Might and Greed
Posted on February 24, 2011 by David

Public employees unions are an interesting hybrid. Industrial unions are organized against the might and greed of ownership. Public employees unions are organized against the might and greed...of the public?—Joe Klein at Time Magazine

## Discriminating
Posted on February 22, 2011 by David

The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race. — Chief Justice John Roberts (Parents Involved In Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1 [June 28, 2007])

## Entitlement and Obligation
Posted on February 12, 2011 by David

The “Affordable Care Act” will provide services for people at present unable to pay for them. This is presumably a good thing for those people. Someone else will be required to pay. I am more interested in discussing on what principle those receiving obtained their entitlements, and where those required to pay obtained their obligations than I am in what we call this adjustment. — Jerry Pournelle

## Scientific Religion
Posted on January 31, 2011 by David

So far neither Dark Energy nor the Multiverse seem to generate falsifiable hypotheses, removing them from science and relegating them to religion. I cheerfully admit that in the absence of evidence I prefer the religion I grew up with to these new ones, but perhaps I am insufficiently flexible in my views.— Jerry Pournelle

## Good or Better?
Posted on January 25, 2011 by David

When everything is good enough, it takes work to discover what’s better, and better is often a matter of whim and preference anyway. — Jerry Pournelle

## Real Science
Posted on January 21, 2011 by David

Real science looks at data, makes falsifiable predictions, and attempts to falsify or confirm those predictions. The rest is ‘other forces’ at work. — Jerry Pournelle

## Algorithms
Posted on January 21, 2011 by David

Algorithms are for people who don’t know how to buy RAM. — Clay Sharky, attributed to an unnamed computer science professor.

## Noble Prizes?
Posted on January 20, 2011 by David

Meanwhile, the 2009 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize has thrown a state dinner for the man who has imprisoned the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. Another previous Nobel Peace Prize winner was in attendance at this honor.— Jerry Pournelle

## Quotations
Posted on January 9, 2011 by David

The problem with Internet quotations is that many are not genuine. — Abraham Lincoln

# Science
Posted on December 23, 2010 by David

When everything is evidence of the thing you want to believe, it might be time to stop pretending you're all about science. — Ann Althouse

## Asteroids
Posted on December 17, 2010 by David

When the Communists show up to protest the Nazis, you’re supposed to pray for an asteroid, not pick a favourite. — Glenn Reynolds

## Trust
Posted on December 16, 2010 by David

Why are those Americans who are most distrustful of the U.S. government, and so eager to undermine it, the same ones who are most desperate to give it control over their own lives? — Abe Greenwald

## Hands
Posted on December 15, 2010 by David

I would fain be to the eternal God what a man’s hand is to a man. — Theologia Germanica

## Belief
Posted on December 13, 2010 by David

In my experience over 90% of the arguments and criticisms made against Christianity can be answered with, “Yeah, I don’t believe in a God like that either.” — Jim S.

## Science
Posted on December 12, 2010 by David

We approach the subject (prayer) in a spirit of scientific enquiry. The question to be asked is not what according to our theology God ought to do, but what He actually does. — Lewis Maclachlan

## Superstition
Posted on December 12, 2010 by David

We must do our best to see life as it really is and not as modern superstition interprets it. — Lewis Maclachlan

## Bankrupt Ideas?
Posted on December 5, 2010 by David

We are claiming that a bankrupt government can save a bankrupt banking system. Explain to me how that happens, because I think that’s impossible... — Alan Keyes

## Normalcy
Posted on November 23, 2010 by David

It’s just routine, Ma’am. This is the new normal. You wanted change, didn’t you? — Jerry Pournelle

## A Ruling Class and It’s Perils
Posted on November 23, 2010 by David

While Europeans are accustomed to being ruled by presumed betters whom they distrust, the American people’s realization of being ruled like Europeans shocked this country into well nigh revolutionary attitudes.—Angelo M. Codevilla

Reminds me of Stein’s Law: “If something can’t go on forever, it will stop.”

Or maybe Zimmerman’s Observation: “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.”

## Time
Posted on November 10, 2010 by David

It is only in appearance that time is a river. It is rather a vast landscape and it is the eye of the beholder that moves. — Thornton Wilder (The Eighth Day)

## Testimony
Posted on November 8, 2010 by David

It isn’t irrational to accept the testimony of eyewitnesses to miracles. — Antonin Scalia

## Bipartisanship
Posted on November 4, 2010 by David

Barack Obama helped elect 255 Democrats to the House in 2008. This year, he helped elect 240 Republicans to the House. Now that’s bipartisanship! — Don Surber

## TOTD
Posted on November 2, 2010 by David

The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. — Carroll Quigley

## TOTD
Posted on October 29, 2010 by David

Being intelligent is not a felony, but most societies evaluate it as at least a misdemeanor. — Robert A. Heinlein

## TOTD
Posted on October 20, 2010 by David

Every atom of fear, or condemnation, or criticism, that we carry in our hearts, no matter for whom it may be, is a wall between ourselves and God. — Emmet Fox

## Giving and Forgiving
Posted on October 12, 2010 by David

If you have ill will toward any, if you are prejudiced against any, if you have accused any even in your silent thought, of injustice, or if you have criticised any one, sit down alone at night before retiring and mentally ask to forgive you. Calling him by name, silently confess to him what you have done, and ask his forgiveness, telling him as you do the others, over and over again, that you love him, and are sure there is nothing but God’s Love between you. Never retire until you have thus definitely “cleaned up the slate” between yourself and every other human being, having definitely forgiven—given love for—every one. Keep at this until all the tightened cords which have been cutting off the free flow of God’s love and life through you are loosened; until a habit of forgiving is established within you. — H. Emilie Cady (God a Present Help)

## TOTD
Posted on September 28, 2010 by David

Attack is the reaction; I never think I have hit hard, unless it rebounds. — Dr. Samuel Johnson, 1775

## TOTD
Posted on September 1, 2010 by David

Never in history have so many advocates with so little common sense held so much influence over so selfish a class who were elected by so gullible a public for such irrelevant reasons. — Roy Spencer, Ph.D.

## TOTD
Posted on August 1, 2010 by David

Leaking high policy is one thing; fingering a village elder so that he and his family can be beheaded is another. Wikileaks drips blood. — Jerry Pournelle

## TOTD
Posted on July 30, 2010 by David

If there were no God, there would be no atheists. — Gilbert K. Chesterton

## TOTD
Posted on July 28, 2010 by David

Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts. — Richard Feynman

## TOTD

We are as gods, and might as well get good at it. - The Whole Earth Catalog (1968)

## TOTD
Posted on July 9, 2010 by David

All attacks on science are ultimately an attack on freedom. All attacks on religion are ultimately an attack on mind. — Robert W. Godwin

## TOTD
Posted on June 1, 2010 by David

You can safely assume that you’ve created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the people you do. — Anne Lamott (Traveling Mercies, credited to “my priest friend Tom”)

## TOTD
Posted on May 13, 2010 by David

If you don’t read the newspaper, you are uninformed. If you do read the newspaper, you are misinformed. —Mark Twain

## Outrage
Posted on May 11, 2010 by David

It is not more objective to narrate an outrage calmly. — James Chastek

## Tyranny of the Mayors
Posted on May 3, 2010 by David

It’s not that I am opposed to government, I am opposed to big, centralized, overwhelming, national government. Give me the Tyranny of the Mayors, I can change mayors faster than Dominos can deliver pizza!—Martin Lee Rose

## Reality
Posted on April 30, 2010 by David

For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled. —Richard Feynman

## Understanding
Posted on April 19, 2010 by David

It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it. — Upton Sinclair

## Algorithms Yet Again
Posted on April 14, 2010 by David

To Amazon’s credit, I didn’t find anything to add to this category yesterday. That may have been from a lack of trying, but so be it.

This morning it was easy — paging backward through the 44 screens of recommendations, I immediately came upon “Indigenous South Americans of the Past and Present: An Ecological Perspective.”

How so? “Because you rated...” — are you ready — John Keegan’s “A History of Warfare.”

Your guess is as good as mine, since the product description is full of “ecological anthropology,” “adaptive systems” and dizzying phrases like “Utilizing ethnographic and archaeological data and an update paradigmderived from the best features of cultural ecology...”

One useful data point — it is paired in the “Frequently Bought Together” with Victor Davis Hanson’s “Carnage and Culture” — are these new paradigm cultural ecologists in fact closet warmongers? There has to be an interesting research project buried in there somewhere, if the right grant can be found.

## Algorithms Redux
Posted on April 12, 2010 by David

This could turn into a regular feature...

Today's entry begins with my having rated William James’ “The Varieties of Religious Experience” five stars.

The Amazonian responds with “Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity” by Jose Esteban Munoz.

Like yesterday's jump from Iwo Jima to highly efficient potty training, the connection is fascinating. Or rather, that an algorithm made the connection teases the mind. Some sort of metadata adheres to each of these “ordered pairs” that ties them together, but what that might look like escapes me.

Stay tuned!

## Algorithms
Posted on April 11, 2010 by David

A little self-disclosure...

I love books. I write software. I struggle with a tendency to be critical.

These traits manifested together a few moments ago as I visited the Amazon site. With their knowledge of my tastes in books, they recommended that I buy “Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day: Proven Secrets of the Potty Pro.”

As a proud Grandfather and Great Grandfather I’ve bought gifts for expectant parents over the past few years, so I wondered what purchase(s) the recommendation was based upon. I like to do my part in refining the data that their algorithms consume so as to give them the best chance to tempt me. So, I clicked on the “Fix this recommendation” link.

It turns out that I was offered advice on potty training because I have read James Bradley's “Flags of Our Fathers,” the story of the men who raised the flag on Mt. Suribachi.

I began today with a bemused smile, courtesy of Amazon.com — thanks!

## Smarts

## Improvisation
Posted on February 9, 2010 by David

Great improvisers are like priests. They are thinking only of their God. — Stéphane Grappelli

## Habit
Posted on February 5, 2010 by David

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, it’s a habit. — Aristotle

## Sex and Science
Posted on January 29, 2010 by David
 
Science is a lot like sex. Sometimes something useful comes of it, but that’s not the reason we’re doing it.—Richard Feynman

## Commas
Posted on January 29, 2010 by David

The older I grow, the less important the comma becomes. Let the reader catch his own breath. — Elizabeth Clarkson Zwart

## Trust
Posted on January 20, 2010 by David

It is to me a new and consolatory proof that wherever the people are well-informed they can be trusted with their own government; that whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied on to set them to rights. — Thomas Jefferson to Richard Price, January 8, 1789

## Research
Posted on January 5, 2010 by David

If academic research is not devoted to finding the truth, it is a form of propaganda, and not necessarily to be preferred to other forms, much cheaper and perhaps more persuasive. — Conrad Russell (Academic Freedom. London: Routledge. 1993)

## Data
Posted on January 1, 2010 by David

If they do that with marks and grades, should they be trusted with experimental data? — Harry Erwin, PhD

## Fallacy
Posted on December 30, 2009 by David
