** 15:08 Got my application in - discovered that I need to renew my passport, and nobody seems to take passport pictures these days. Valerie’s application bombed out because of her old green card. I’ve completed her application for replacement - the fee is over $500!
** 21:21 RAC went well. Going to be a chilly night - the new plants that Valerie bought the other day are all in the kitchen overnight.

** 10:24 Back from the eye appointment. Drops have my vision somewhat fuzzy. Not a big change, but some. Worth the $40. Nigel is speaking at his home group at 1500.

** 07:05 2310-0624, 6:22 87. Clear, 30F. The prospect of becoming a citizen, or even just the issues around updating her green card, if weighing heavily on Valerie. Perhaps the best next step will be to get in touch with our Congressperson or Senator’s office and find out whether there’s any way to pull some strings and get TSAPre or Global Entry with her present card.
** 14:33 Bread is in the oven - just dropped the temperature, 30 minutes to go. Have added a few notes to the Foreign outline and also WarStory.
** 19:24 Spaghetti for dinner.

** 09:29 Good meeting - the 9th Step Promises. I mentioned Marguerite’s “5 years to get your brain out of hock” and wrote down “Triumphalism” - must be cautious about concern for Kristen. Dan F. is in surgery now - prayers for the surgical team. Planning on a haircut this morning.
** 11:57 Had my first summer haircut at Royal - Tina did the job and it feels good so far. Valerie is less pleased than I am, but so it goes.
** 15:53 Valerie has bought 20 bags of mulch at Franks. She brought 15 bags home and I unloaded them into the carport. She’s gone back for the other 5. I filled the little green bin with biloba shreds from the front yard - she has a place in the back to put it. I’m planning to take it somewhat slow these next few warm, sunny days and not overdo it.

** 10:44 About to do some mulch spreading. Last night at the meeting it occurred to me that the next chapter in War Story to tackle would be Barbara’s Birthday - Dad leaves for Boston, Mom sees him off, in labor, goes to the lecture, then off to the hospital. Wotta Woman!
** 15:47 Put 17 bags of mulch down in front. 4 bags around the deck and the Black Gum, 13 on the garden. Just a wee bit left to do there, will wait until we open another bag to put in the back and fill that in then. Three bags left. 
** 19:21 A hot soak with epsom salts seems to have helped my aching back.

** 08:57 Ready to go, quite early. It’s a lovely day outside! And I’m not terribly sore or stiff. How nice!
** 14:06 Heading out for Jesse’s.
** 17:28 We forgot the candy, so got as far as 32 and 1 and turned around. Still got there by 1530, Jesse was sound asleep. We had a nice visit and got home a few minutes ago. Getting dinner from Pizza Man.

** 07:18 Woke up late - 0712. 53F light clouds. Fitbit thinks I didn’t go back to sleep after 0520 but it’s wrong. Actually slept from 2332-0712. It says 5:42 85.
** 08:23 And it got smart enough to notice that I had gone back to sleep. 2332-0710, 6:59 89.
** 18:10 Drove to Rockville to meet with Steven Katz - found out that he was expecting a virtual meeting, but it turned out fine. Valerie was a good friend of his wife, so there was some sharing about her (she’s died) and it turns out that it’s very worthwhile to update things. It won’t be too cheap - $4,500 - but that should be the last time we do it. District 7 meeting at 1900.

** 13:42 We went shopping at 10 to Haverty’s for recliners. Found one that might do for about $650. It might be hard to find two recliners that will fit both of us and that will also work in our living room. Unless they were the kind that can be right against a wall we’d have to find somewhere else for the wicker trunk. Talked about maybe finding a place for mine in the guest bedroom, like in Bloomington. Back in time for her meeting, and I finished the Passport application, the OMCA vote, and Katz’s check. Got those in the mail, went on to Home Depot and got the 1x4 for the base under the cabinet in the LR. Would like to get some writing done today. Thinking of going ahead with the San Diego adventure instead of anything near to the start. It’s too hard to get the back-story in at this stage.

** 12:25 Twice this month (and it’s only the 10th) I’ve been notified that a parcel would be delivered that day, and still nothing. The book was in Linthicum (a 4-hour walk!) on March 31 - that’s the last news that they have on it. The fabric was promised delivery yesterday, now they say it’s somewhere east of California! Parcel Post seems to eat nasty these days. When they were trying to shit on President Trump, it was understandable - they have a union. But now?
** 20:25 Valerie went to Restore and bought a box of tiles for the fireplace for $10 and a powered recliner for herself for $100. It’s home and working.

** 14:01 Church went fine, back home now (obviously). Valerie is sleeping. Jesse texted that he’d re-applied for disability (was turned-down in 2006) and they just wired $45,000 to his bank account. That will help, I guess.

** 14:42 We took a good walk, fed the fish and geese, lay down for a bit. Back is pretty sore, Valerie put some diclonofec (sp) on it and gave me naproxin (sp again). Maybe that’ll help. She’ll talk with Ans at 1500. I go to the Men’s Dinner tonight and then come home for the meeting to support Janet.

I focused on those resentful, sad, whatever thoughts that pop up and we just don’t give them any attention. Valerie was concerned about getting her rosacea treatment - Humana had it on back order. Major run-arounds finally ended up with a pharmacy in Silver Spring - Musgrove - who has it for $65 instead of $750. She’s just back from Wegman’s. Had a nap from 1710-1821, 1:09, then fixed spaghetti with mushrooms and sausage and wilted spinach.

** 11:41 Had a quick walk with Valerie, it’s a beautiful day and would love to get the mower out for the first time this year, but I really must get a draft for Susan today, and look at the RAC apps. Maybe I’ll get everything in, maybe not. Bread is on the agenda tomorrow, as well as an hour with Susan at 1000 and a visit with Dr. Mizzer at 1715.
** 17:27 Bread is in the oven, I’ve gone over all the RAC applications, didn’t get out to cut grass, but it looks to be a dry day if chillier than today, so that will do. Got the draft to Susan this afternoon. So, a moderately productive day so far.

** 12:45 Good meeting with Susan - she liked the chapter, I’ll send another within the month. I spent some time cutting grass, spread the dirt that spent the winter next to the horse manure around the back corner of the yard, squished the grubs that I found, and spread the ginkgo chips on top. Sharpened the mower blade. Plan to visit Macy’s before we go to Dr. Mizzer - if I don’t love the chair Valerie found we’ll pass on it.
** 18:45 It seemed to fit, it was on sale, so I went for it, then Valerie seemed surprised. Amazing how easy it is to confuse each other after all these years. Made it to Dr. Mizzer.

Trying to tell whether a headache is caused by the new glasses or my neck. Still up in the air. Decided to take some of the nice childrens’ books to Barb’s next Sunday when Patti is there. Thinking about a walk in a little while.
** 11:14 Updated brave and something else and xfce went haywire. None of the panels worked. Rebooted, logged in and out a few times, played with the settings. They work now, when I log in I got a “no panels” message but it was a lie. Screwy! Oh, well, it’s working now, I think.

** 09:14 Karen led on the 12th step, carrying the message. I spoke fairly early, before 0800, and was afterward concerned that I’d rambled on too long. Turns out that we were finished well before 0830.
** 13:36 Turns out that the meeting in Henfield near Brighton was at 1700 zulu, not 1730. I caught that in time, and the whole meeting went smoothly. I read the first two paragraphs in the 4th Tradition and applied it to my letting most AA members to say and do what they will - hopefully only interrupting if their comments are unbearably far from what the AA program suggests.
** 21:41 At some point today fitbit figured out that my sleep score was 92, for what that’s worth.

** 09:05 Read the 10th Step Promises, Michael said that he “loved drinking, loved the taste and the bright colors of the labels” etc. Don’t think that he’d shared that with me - mainly just said that he experienced urges. Asked him to call me at 0830 via text, nothing yet.
** 11:56 Michael and I spoke - he said that he appreciated my suggestion. Insisted that he is using Anabuse to make his wife and daughter comfortable on the Pocanos trip. I got some part numbers for IKEA when we go there next. Valerie is not feeling well - bowel issues again.
** 16:24 We managed a walk, and Valerie is now draping cloth over the redbud to keep cicadias off.

** 12:27 Smoke alarm in LR went off about a half hour ago with a loud beep and “Error Detected, please refer to troubleshooting” or something to that effect. When I found one of the manuals, there was nothing to be found with that message. After a time, I pushed the button, the green light came on and we’ve heard nothing since. I took the compressed air and blew all of them out - I hadn’t done that for a month or two. Fingers crossed now. Still not very impressed with Kidde Intellighent Wire-Free Smoke Alarms (tm).

Did complain a bit that the TSG wasn’t posting its meeting on the District site, and not all were on the Intergroup site (this is our primary purpose!). Don’t think I was too far over the top - but I did stress the point up to a certain point. Or maybe just beyone a certain point. Not sure.
