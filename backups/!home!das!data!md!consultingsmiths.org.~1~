*Doodzwijgen
Posted on December 4, 2019 by David Smith	

“The Dutch language knows the priceless verb ‘doodzwijgen’, literally ‘kill something by keeping silent about it’. This has been a favorite tactic of European Brahmandarins for a long time—the near-media silence on the continuing Yellow Jackets protests is only the most recent example.”—[Nitay Arbel](


*Healthy Media Consumption
Posted on December 2, 2019 by David Smith	

    I watch zero cable news.
    I don’t read Twitter.
    I use Facebook only to keep up with people who I care about personally. I tell myself to never, never comment on or share political posts on Facebook.

    On my blog, I do not comment on any story I come across for at least 48 hours. Often, this means that I do not comment at all, because many stories do not stay in the news cycle more than two days. I almost never publish any post immediately. Instead, I schedule posts several days ahead. I am trying to make sure that I engage system 2 (sober and reflective) rather than system 1 (emotional and instinctive).
    I try to give priority to long-form reading: books, essays, and journal articles. I also give priority to my own writing. Still, I need to get better about limiting the time that I spend on short-term reading.
    I believe that it is a good idea to keep all devices in airplane mode for a 24-hour period once a week. I have difficulty executing this one, particularly when I travel.
    I spend at least an hour a day doing physical activity (for me, it’s walking or biking or working out in the basement) accompanied by nothing but my thoughts and daydreams.
    My sleep-time ritual is to curl up with a physical book or journal.


*Thanksgiving
Posted on November 28, 2019 by David Smith	

AA’s “24 Hours a Day” Meditation for November 28th:

Gratitude to God is the theme of Thanksgiving Day. The pilgrims gathered to give thanks for their harvest which was pitifully small. When we look around at all the things we have today, how can we help being grateful to God? Our families, our homes, our friends, our A.A. fellowship: all these things are free gifts of God to us. “But for the grace of God,” we would not have them.

Today’s prayer:

I pray that I may be very grateful today. I pray that I may not forget where I might be but for the grace of God.


*We’re new here

)This is the new Consultingsmiths blog. Just got it set up, haven’t made it pretty or clever-that’s for another day. For now, just wanted to get it off of the old host and onto the new host.

More later.

The old stuff is somewhere else and won’t be backfilled here. You won’t miss it.
