** 14:02 Happy New Year! I neglected to start a 20210101 backup of the data drive, so I didn't begin this until it had finished (and I did a GNUCash backup and started the media backup). I slept well, 0033-0857, 7:49 90. Michael S. called - second day in a row. Valerie suggested that we replace the mattress, and I wholeheartedly agree. We'll begin some research to make our choice. Miriam's whole family came by around 1300 with a Birthday card (handmade) and a Happy New Years card, plus an oragami phoenix. Joey isn't doing well and may be put down soon.
