## Our Limited Imagination
Monday, 4 January 2021

“Now my own suspicion is that the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we *can* suppose.”–J.B.S. Haldane, *Possible World and Other Papers* (1927) p.286

“Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it.”—Niels Bohr, *Essays 1932-1957 on Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge*

“Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.”—Niels Bohr

“I feel very much like Dirac: the idea of a personal God is foreign to me. But we ought to remember that religion uses language in quite a different way from science. The language of religion is more closely related to the language of poetry than to the language of science. True, we are inclined to think that science deals with information about objective facts, and poetry with subjective feelings. Hence we conclude that if religion does indeed deal with objective truths, it ought to adopt the same criteria of truth as science. But I myself find the division of the world into an objective and a subjective side much too arbitrary. The fact that religions through the ages have spoken in images, parables, and paradoxes means simply that there are no other ways of grasping the reality to which they refer. But that does not mean that it is not a genuine reality. And splitting this reality into an objective and a. subjective side won't get us very far.”—Niels Bohr, after the Solvay Converence (1927) quoted by Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Beyond* (1971) found at [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr)

## The Persistent Illusion
Monday, 4 January 2021

“Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”—Albert Einstein

## The Road to Hell
Monday, 4 January 2021

“Hell can’t be made attractive, so the devil makes attractive the road that leads there.”—Saint Basil the Great

## Indifference
Monday, 4 January 2021

## Cured of Newspapers
Monday, 4 January 2021

(ed.) A year? A week, if that! Should work with expert blogs and cable news shows, too.
