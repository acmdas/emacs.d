** Beasts
Monday, 17 May 2021

** Koestler’s Rule and other quotes
Sunday, 02 May 2021

“One should either write ruthlessly what one believes to be the truth, or else shut up.”—Arthur Koestler

“The evolution of the brain not only overshot the needs of prehistoric man, it is the only example of evolution providing a species with an organ which it does not know how to use.”—Arthur Koestler

“If power corrupts, the reverse is also true; persecution corrupts the victims though perhaps in subtler and more tragic ways.”—Arthur Koestler

“When a person identifies himself with a group his critical faculties are diminished and his passions enhanced by a kind of emotive resonance. The individual is not a killer, the group is, and by identifying with it, the individual becomes one. This is the infernal dialect reflected in man’s history.”—Arthur Koestler

“Wars are not fought for territory, but for words. Man’s deadliest weapon is language. He is as susceptible to being hypnotized by slogans as he is to infectious diseases. And where there is an epidemic, the group-mind takes over.”—Arthur Koestler

** Censorship
Saturday, 24 April 2021

** Newspapers

** Buy and Sell
Friday, 12 March 2021

“When buying and selling are controlled by legislation, the first things to be bought and sold are legislators.”—P.J. O’Rourke

** Intelligence and Education
Tuesday, 09 March 2021

“Never confuse education with intelligence, you can have a PhD and still be an idiot.”—Richard Feynman

** Enemy of Knowledge
Monday, 08 March 2021

“The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.”—Daniel Boorstin

** Infinity, and Beyond
Sunday, 07 March 2021

“The field of the finite is all that we can see, hear, touch, remember and describe. This field is basically that which is manifest, or tangible. The essential quality of the infinite, by contrast, is its subtlety, its intangibility. This quality is conveyed in the word spirit, whose root meaning is “wind or breath.” This suggests an invisible but pervasive energy to which the manifest world of the finite responds. This energy, or spirit, infuses all living beings, and without it any organism must fall apart into its constituent elements. That which is truly alive in the living being is the energy of spirit, and this is never born and never dies.”—David Bohm, an obituary for a friend (and read at his own funeral)

** Stories

** Modern Politics
Tuesday, 02 March 2021

“What this brings out is that modern politics cannot be a matter of genuine moral consensus. And it is not. Modern politics is civil war carried on by other means,”—Alasdair MacIntyre, /After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory/, Third Edition

** Crying Out
Tuesday, 02 March 2021

“To cry out that the emperor had no clothes on was at least to pick on one man only to the amusement of everyone else; to declare that almost everyone is dressed in rags is much less likely to be popular.”—Alasdair MacIntyre, /After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory/, Third Edition

** Moral Community
Tuesday, 02 March 2021

“If my account of our moral condition is correct, we ought also to conclude that for some time now we too have reached that turning point. What matters at this stage is the construction of local forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us.”—Alasdair MacIntyre, /After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory/, Third Edition

“A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.”—William James

** Challenges
Wednesday, 27 January 2021

“The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance. 

“We must daily decide whether the threats we face are real, whether the solutions we are offered will do any good, whether the problems we're told exist are in fact real problems, or non-problems.”—Michael Crichton (from a 2003 speech)

** Easy to Please
Monday, 11 January 2021

"Though Jesus Christ is very hard to satisfy, He is very easy to please. Think of that and it will help you a little. He is very easy to please, but very hard to satisfy. If you will but let Him in, and you have not much to put on the table. You cannot share much of life because you have not got it, He will be so pleased, if it be but a cup of cold water that you can give him. Let it be something genuine, something real." -- George MacDonald. From the sermon "The Father's Appeal", preached in Westminster Chapel.

** Narrative
Friday, 08 January 2021

"For some years now, the comfortable classes in today's America have lost track of the fact that control over the public narrative does not equal control over the facts underlying the narrative...Convince yourself that something is true, and the universe has to play along: that's the mentality of a frighteningly large share of the privileged in America these days."---[[https://www.ecosophia.net/into-the-unknown-region/][John Michael Greer]]

More pithy comments on the falsehoods behind the narrative, and the possible or even likely consequences, can be found there. Worth the read.

** Rivers of Blood
Friday, 08 January 2021

"As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see"the River Tiber foaming with much blood.”---Enoch Powell MP, quoting Virgil in /The Rivers of Blood/ speech, April 20, 1968

And that was 1968. I remember 1968. I turned 21, but too late to vote in that year. I remember watching much of Hippy evolve into angry thug.

** Law Abiding
Friday, 08 January 2021

"Remember that the people that hid Anne Frank were breaking the law and the people that took her to the camps were enforcing it."---Seen on a blog and no reference found yet...still looking.

** A Magnificent Bribe
Monday, 04 January 2021

"The bargain we are being asked to ratify takes the form of a magnificent bribe. Under the democratic-authoritarian social contract, each member of the community may claim every material advantage, every intellectual and emotional stimulus he may desire, in quantities hardly available hitherto even for a restricted minority: food, housing, swift transportation, instantaneous communication, medical care, entertainment, education. But on one condition: that one must not merely ask for nothing that the system does not provide, but likewise agree to take everything offered, duly processed and fabricated, homogenized and equalized, in the precise quantities that the system, rather than the person, requires. Once one opts for the system no further choice remains. In a word, if one surrenders one's life at source, authoritarian technics will give back as much of it as can be mechanically graded, quantitatively multiplied, collectively manipulated and magnified."---Lewis Mumford, /Authoritarian and Democratic Technics/ (1964)

** Mad Times
Monday, 04 January 2021

"To be sane in a mad time is bad for the brain, or worse for the heart."---Wendell Berry, /The Mad Farmer Manifesto: The First Amendment/

"Now my own suspicion is that the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we /can/ suppose."--J.B.S. Haldane, /Possible World and Other Papers/ (1927) p.286

"Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it."---Niels Bohr, /Essays 1932-1957 on Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge/

"Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real."---Niels Bohr

"I feel very much like Dirac: the idea of a personal God is foreign to me. But we ought to remember that religion uses language in quite a different way from science. The language of religion is more closely related to the language of poetry than to the language of science. True, we are inclined to think that science deals with information about objective facts, and poetry with subjective feelings. Hence we conclude that if religion does indeed deal with objective truths, it ought to adopt the same criteria of truth as science. But I myself find the division of the world into an objective and a subjective side much too arbitrary. The fact that religions through the ages have spoken in images, parables, and paradoxes means simply that there are no other ways of grasping the reality to which they refer. But that does not mean that it is not a genuine reality. And splitting this reality into an objective and a subjective side won't get us very far."---Niels Bohr, after the Solvay Converence (1927) quoted by Werner Heisenberg, /Physics and Beyond/ (1971) found at [[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr][Wikiquote]]

** The Persistent Illusion

** Cured of Newspapers

(ed.) A year? A week, if that! Should work with expert blogs and cable news shows, too.
