** 07:16 2320-0634, 6:34 89. Raining, 40F. We go to TSAPreCheck clearance at Staples today at 1300.
** 15:08 Got my application in - discovered that I need to renew my passport, and nobody seems to take passport pictures these days. Valerie’s application bombed out because of her old green card. I’ve completed her application for replacement - the fee is over $500!
** 21:21 RAC went well. Going to be a chilly night - the new plants that Valerie bought the other day are all in the kitchen overnight.

** 07:10 0031-0620, 5:23 83. Clear, 29F. Eye exam at 1000, take photo to Walgreen’s to print as passport photo.
** 10:24 Back from the eye appointment. Drops have my vision somewhat fuzzy. Not a big change, but some. Worth the $40. Nigel is speaking at his home group at 1500.

** 07:05 2310-0624, 6:22 87. Clear, 30F. The prospect of becoming a citizen, or even just the issues around updating her green card, if weighing heavily on Valerie. Perhaps the best next step will be to get in touch with our Congressperson or Senator’s office and find out whether there’s any way to pull some strings and get TSAPre or Global Entry with her present card.
** 14:33 Bread is in the oven - just dropped the temperature, 30 minutes to go. Have added a few notes to the Foreign outline and also WarStory.
** 19:24 Spaghetti for dinner.

** 09:29 Good meeting - the 9th Step Promises. I mentioned Marguerite’s “5 years to get your brain out of hock” and wrote down “Triumphalism” - must be cautious about concern for Kristen. Dan F. is in surgery now - prayers for the surgical team. Planning on a haircut this morning.
** 11:57 Had my first summer haircut at Royal - Tina did the job and it feels good so far. Valerie is less pleased than I am, but so it goes.
** 15:53 Valerie has bought 20 bags of mulch at Franks. She brought 15 bags home and I unloaded them into the carport. She’s gone back for the other 5. I filled the little green bin with biloba shreds from the front yard - she has a place in the back to put it. I’m planning to take it somewhat slow these next few warm, sunny days and not overdo it.

** 09:16 Tradition 4 this morning, Dan F is back. 
** 10:44 About to do some mulch spreading. Last night at the meeting it occurred to me that the next chapter in War Story to tackle would be Barbara’s Birthday - Dad leaves for Boston, Mom sees him off, in labor, goes to the lecture, then off to the hospital. Wotta Woman!
** 15:47 Put 17 bags of mulch down in front. 4 bags around the deck and the Black Gum, 13 on the garden. Just a wee bit left to do there, will wait until we open another bag to put in the back and fill that in then. Three bags left. 
** 19:21 A hot soak with epsom salts seems to have helped my aching back.
