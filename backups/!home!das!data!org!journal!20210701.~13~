** 07:20 Happy Canada Day!
** 07:38 Adriana asked about Craig - he’s been evacuated with the fire only a mile fron the trailer. On his way to Rawleen’s in Kamloops as of 2300.
** 12:17 Went to Mother Nature’s and got safflower seed, and to Giant for a card and gift bag, and to deposit my Canada Pension check. All the major backups are run and copied to the WDBook. Not yet copied to the offsite drives. Turning to RAC business now.
** 17:13 Think I’m ready for RAC. Had a nap, had a shower. Valerie talked with Craig again and with Ans. The /data backup is copied to WDBook and Offsite2, /media is copying to Media as I type.
** 19:09 Fed, cleaned-up, about ready for the RAC performance.
** 23:00 RAC went well, I’d say. Finished by 2100. Still have three tabled apps. Craig heard that his trailer survived the fire.

** 06:50 2335-0604, 5:53 81. 68F cloudy, forecast 81F some showers this morning. 44th Anniversary, Joe’s Birthday today.
** 09:33 Washed dishes and am boiling eggs. Valerie is planning to go to Aquafit in a bit. Downloaded a pdf of “Lisp in Small Pieces” and converted it to epub.
** 17:05 Washed delicates, Valerie is pleased with her perfume, I’m happy with the Magic Flute dvd and the plug converters for the Amsterdam trip. We’re off to dinner at PF Chang at 1800.
** 19:28 And we’re home. Valerie had tempura shrimp rolls, I had chicken pad thai. Very nice spring rolls to get started. Took a stroll around the mall, got an estimate to resize her ring, and so to home. She seems to have enjoyed it a lot.

** 11:57 Fixed Valerie’s password file and ran her updates. Went for a walk and returned Mim’s drywall knives. Ate a bit of lunch and am ready to do some lawn work to honor the nice weather.
** 13:32 Dug up the remaining bush roots on the S side and turned-over a bit more of the upcoming garden ground. Enough to get me a bit puffed. Cooling off now.
** 22:53 A quiet afternoon, rain around 2100.

** 12:14 Back from church - morning prayer. Costco is closed, so we stopped at Giant for oat milk, cherries, lettuce and corn. Will have shrimp salad for dinner.
** 15:56 Bread in pans rising - new stools arrived, one is cracked, will see what Valerie wants to do.
** 21:17 Damaged stool returned to Target - they’ll ship another directly to the house. Made shrimp and avocado salad for dinner. Bread nturned out fine. Watched another GOT. Pumped up RF tire.

** 17:15 Mowed front and back. Agreed to take Bruce and his mower to Ellicott City for repairs Tuesday midday. Valerie’s knitting group meets at 1030 tomorrow in the carport. Miriam and the girls came by for a nice visit.
** 22:22 Good meeting, Carl’s 32nd anniversary and Rosslyn came.

** 06:36 2307-0558, 6:06 79. 68F light cloud, forecast 96F. Fitbit consistently fails to recognize that I’m awake/out of bed, because I walk around a little, then sit and meditate?
** 13:55 Right after the meeting I watered the deck plants and started the weeping hose. Cleaned out the carport and set up for the knitting group. Took Bruce to the Ellicott City Home Depot to drop off his lawn mower for repairs. It’s currently 94F.
** 21:07 Drove Valerie to the far side of Baltimore to pick up Japanese Willow branches to stick in water and, eventually, in the ground. She’s now working at warping her loom (instead of watching GOT). I attended the special OMCA Board meeting to interview two applicants for Board membership. Chances are either would be fine, I’m leaning toward the young woman since she grew up in and lives in the apartments and might be able to involve her neighbors in the community more.

** 10:21 Back from walking with Michael. 91F. Going to cool off a bit - upper to mid-80s through the weekend. Predicting a thunderstorm around 1400-1600 this afternoon - would be nice, but we’ll wait and see. Tired - missed evening meds last night and slept poorly, as usual in that circumstance.
** 11:07 Copied Zuby’s “20 Things” from Twitter and put on my website at zuby.html. Pointed to it by SDA yesterday.
** 22:23 Napped this afternoon, had Chinese shrimp with broccoli for dinner, watched a GOT. Fixed Valerie’s Kindle Fire to read epubs so she could read all the Jodi Taylor’s that we have.

** 09:33 No solid food today. Clear fluids only. Had coffee and two cups of chicken broth so far. About to go for a walk. Almost popped a cherry in my mouth without thinking. Took one bite but didn’t chew or swallow. A close call! Did sleep like a rock last night.

** 12:30 Valerie returned the sprinkler and bought a more substantial one. And got gas. I’m not surprisingly, hungry. Chicken stock helps, I’m sure, but it doesn’t do the job 100%. I have enough of a headache that I’m distracted, but not unbearably yet. Knowing that it’ll be over by 1000 tomorrow helps.
** 17:46 I’ve managed to get down the first bottle of “suprep” and am waiting for it to take effect.
** 22:25 It took until around 2100 for the gloop to work, and it seems to have settled down for now. Another shot at 0200.

** 04:13 2321-0200. Took the second dose of the gloop and 32 oz. water, then waited. Quite nauseated, getting better by now. All in all hasn’t been totally dreadful. Won’t be that long - 6 hours or so - and I’ll be done with it. No fluids after 0400, I’ll be waiting until I get home to take my morning meds. Stomach is settling down, headache eased some. Been reading “Kim”.
** 14:34 It’s all over and I’ve had about 4 hours sleep. Valerie is at Wegman’s I assume. They found two polyps, as long as they’re not malignant I’ll have another procedure in 3 years. Coffee is on the make.
** 22:48 Ready for bed, just had a bath. Salmon and spinach for dinner, GOT afterward.

** 16:08 Did a bunch of work outdoors this morning. Got the new flowers that Valerie bought a few days ago planted under the office window and covered with cardboard. Used the new sprinkler on the front garden - might not work right if the pressure is too low. Washed the bed and made it up afterward, had a sharp word with Valerie when she wouldn’t tell me how she wanted the rags washed and made that face when she got up as if I’d insisted that she stop working on her loom and do it herself. I think the real reason was that she wanted to treat some of her dainties and was shy about that. My bad, I guess. We seem OK now. I did my underwear and helped her restring the loom. Sent some silly pictures to the sibs and Lisa.
** 20:56 Dinner with salmon salad on toast and sweet corn. Ate outside, walked to Miriam’s and fed Chuck. About to GOT.
** 22:45 And so to bed, after a quick soduko.

** 09:05 0110-0747, 6:04 83. 78, cloudy, forecast 89 with possible storms (30%). Went to bed at 2310, at 0020 got up and sat in recliner, surfed videos. Slept, got up after 0400 and went to bed. We’ve decided to not go to Church today. I’m dressed now and will take seed out and take bags off the flowers. Stiff, but not terribly and loosening up easily.
** 13:39 Been converting footnotes in the epub /Saving the Appearances/ into linked endnotes. Up to Chapter 18 of 25, and ready to take a break.
** 18:41 Finished the endnotes, not wildly thrilled with them in mobi but it’s done. Maybe adding the notes page to the TOC will help. Off to Giant now, then dinner and a walk when it’s cooler.

** 11:40 Valerie will return the Target stools this afternoon. I have cleaned out the car and loaded them into the rear. Printed the two orders and found the return paperwork. She went to Wegmans before aquafit. Is in the shower now. Tweaked the Saving the Appearances epub to add notes to the TOC. Loaded it into the Kindle epub folder. Charged the fitbit all morning so got no credit for anything before now. Did a lot of puttering around outside watering this and that. The new sprinkler seems to work if the water flow is high enough. May not be that useful for the front garden - maybe the gray plastic one would be better there.
** 14:12 Woot sent me a $5 coupon to lure me back, so I bought a 6-pack of furnace filters - we’re using the last one of the pack that I ordered on 12/27/2018.
** 22:49 We made chicken with cashews for dinner, it turned out really well. Rain came and let up in time to take care of Chuck and Al before our meetings. More rain just a few minutes ago. I goofed with Mim’s alarm - she got it squared away.

** 17:30 Crawled under the house and didn’t find the “dead” cable - looked inside the breaker box again and found that it is an old piece of romex, not the new one, and it goes out the top of the box, not the bottom. It’ll be worth going down another time and looking around. It could appear along any of the wall sill plates, depending on where the romex originally was run.
** 17:33 Just finished the remarks for this evening’s OMCA Board meeting. a few comments on how bad it looks that the schools here are being stiffed for maintenance, with a veiled threat to go to the Baltimore Sun.
** 17:34 Valerie returned the two stools that she bought at Target and got a refund.
