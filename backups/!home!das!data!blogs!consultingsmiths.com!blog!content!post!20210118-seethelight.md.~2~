## See the Light

“Now no man lighting a candle covered it with a vessel, or Now no man lighting a candle covered it with a vessel, or put it under a bed; but set it upon a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light. For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest, nor hidden, that shall not be known and come abroad.”–Luke 8:16

We are overtaken with secrets that need to be made manifest, unredacted, with names, dates and times.

“There’s somethin’ happenin’ here, what it is ain’t exactly clear. There’s a man with a gun over there, tellin’ me, I’ve got to beware. It’s time we stop, children, what’s that sound? Everybody look what’s goin’ down.”
