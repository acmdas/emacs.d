    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is the interim Consultingsmiths blog location. We've left the Wordpress environment and are in the process of getting our static blog set up. Do come back soon - it shouldn't be this boring for long.</p>
    <p>Over the years WordPress has become a much more complicated tool which, like Microsoft Word, has become less "friendly" to its original user base, that it, writers. And like Microsoft Word, there are other tools that we'd prefer to use, and recent events have made it clear that this is the time to make the jump to those friendlier tools in our online publishing.</p>

    <h1>Elections</h1>
    <p>"Nothing says, 'This was a perfectly normal election, and now it's time to come together as a united nation,' like having your swearing-in behind 12-foot-high razor wire surrounded by 25,000 troops whose loyalty you doubt."â€”Glenn Reynolds</p>
