## You Gotta Be Right
Wednesday, 23 December 2020

“If you're gonna put it on the front page, you gotta make sure it's right. Because if it ain't, you gotta eat it for the next 24 hours.”—Ben Bradlee

That’s how newspaper editors used to think—or at least said that they thought.

## Marxism in a few words
Tuesday, 22 December 2020

“Marxism has a noble vision - for humans to retain their humanity while living as one big happy family. 

“However, that vision fails to consider that familial bonds have limits.

“Most people would take a bullet for their kids, siblings, or parents, but I don't know anyone who'd take a bullet for their fourth cousin's husband, whom they've never met.”—[Louis Pereira](https://www.complexitycondensed.com/p/marxism)

## The World is Made of Events, Not Things
Sunday, 20 December 2020

“There is, nevertheless, an aspect of time that has survived the demolition inflicted on it by nineteenth- and twentieth-century physics. Divested of the trappings with which Newtonian theory had draped it, and to which we had become so accustomed, it now shines out with greater clarity; the world is nothing but change.”—Carlo Rovelli, *The Order of Time* p 96

Time Physics

## Lies
Sunday, 20 December 2020

“I’m not upset that you lied to me; I’m upset that from now on I can’t believe you.”—Friedrich Nietzsche

## Confidence
Friday, 18 December 2020

“It is our knowledge—the things we are sure of—that makes the world go wrong and keeps us from seeing and learning.”—Lincoln Steffens

## Leadership
Friday, 18 December 2020

“Anyone can steer the ship when the sea is calm.”—Publilius Syrus

## Important
Monday, 14 December 2020

“The two most important days of a man’s life are the day he was born and the day he finds out why.”—recently attributed to Mark Twain, but almost certainly inaccurately.

The [Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/22/why/#return-note-13878-1) traces it to a January 25, 1970 sermon delivered at Riverside Church in New York City. Whoever said it first, it’s a useful thought. It’s always wise to be suspicious of any quote attributed to Twain, Einstein, Dalai Lama, etc. As Abe Lincoln used to say, “Don’t trust anything you read on the Internet.”

## Alone
Monday, 07 December 2020

“If you are lonely when you are alone, you are in bad company.”—Jean Paul Sartre

## Government
Monday, 07 December 2020

“Government does not exist to make us equal, but to treat us equally. It does not exist to make life fair, but to treat us fairly.”—Andrew Klavan

## Celebrity
Monday, 07 December 2020

“Moreover, the celebrity’s apparent talent and relevant success teach him to do the things he must not do: to trust himself, to believe that he is a person of virtue, to believe that he is important. This is particularly dangerous when talent and success almost always create both opportunity and motive for serious sin.”—[David French](https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-crisis-of-christian-celebrity)

## Science, Intuition and Discovery
Saturday, 05 December 2020

“It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.”—Henri Poincaré

“Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.”—Immanuel Kant

## Distinguishing
Thursday, 03 December 2020

“The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance.

“We must daily decide whether the threats we face are real, whether the solutions we are offered will do any good, whether the problems we’re told exist are in fact real problems, or non-problems.”—Michael Crichton, *Environmentalism as Religion* speech at Commonwealth Club, San Francisco, CA 15 September 2003

## Certainty
Thursday, 03 December 2020

“I wish I were dumber so I could be more certain about my opinions. It looks fun.”—Scott Adams

## Obvious
Thursday, 03 December 2020

“Every high civilization decays by forgetting obvious things.”—G.K. Chesterton

## Faster
Thursday, 03 December 2020

“If you have everything under control, you’re not moving fast enough.”—Mario Andretti

## Undecided
Sunday, 29 November 2020

“Men do not know how to be either entirely wicked or entirely good... they do not know how to employ violent measures which are honourable in themselves, and as a result, remaining undecided, between their own indecision and their ambiguity they are eliminated.”—Niccolò Machiavelli

## Teddy
Sunday, 29 November 2020

“Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.”—Teddy Roosevelt

“Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell ‘em ‘Certainly I can!’ Then get busy and find out how to do it.”—Teddy Roosevelt

## Education
Friday, 27 November 2020

“The problem is not you being uneducated. The problem is that you are educated just enough to believe what you have been taught, and not educated enough to question anything from what you have been taught.”—Richard Feynman

## Real
Monday, 23 November 2020

“Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real. If quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet.”—Niels Bohr

## Rebel
Sunday, 22 November 2020

“What is a rebel? A man who says no.”—Albert Camus

## Peace and Ease
Sunday, 22 November 2020

“He that would live in peace and ease must not speak all he knows or all he sees.”—Benjamin Franklin

## No Past
Tuesday, 17 November 2020

“A generation which ignores history has no past—and no future.”—Robert A. Heinlein, *Time Enough for Love*

## Totalitarian Truth
Tuesday, 17 November 2020

“The really frightening thing about totalitarianism is not that it commits ‘atrocities’ but that it attacks the concept of objective truth; it claims to control the past as well as the future.”—George Orwell, “As I Please” column in *Tribune*, 4 February 1944

## Totalitarian
Tuesday, 17 November 2020

“A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud.”—George Orwell *The Prevention of Literature*, 1946

## Moving On
Monday, 16 November 2020

“You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”—C.S. Lewis

## Happy
Sunday, 15 November 2020

“A child can teach an adult three things: to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.”—Paulo Coelho, *The Fifth Mountain*

## Freedom of Speech and Thought
Sunday, 15 November, 2020

“People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.”—Søren Kierkegaard

## A Theatre of Dominance and Affiliation
Saturday, 14 November 2020

“Organized sports often turn into a play about status roles and dominance. Bullfighting, pro wrestling, even hockey, are about who’s winning, who’s losing and who’s in charge.

But they are also theatres of affiliation. The fans celebrate their unity as well as their divisions. The pomp and circumstance are a form of culture. There are insiders and outsiders, and the right way and the wrong way.”—[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2020/11/a-theatre-of-dominance/)

## The Study of History
Saturday, 14 November 2020

“The study of history is a powerful antidote to contemporary arrogance. It is humbling to discover how many of our glib assumptions, which seem to us novel and plausible, have been tested before, not once but many times and in innumerable guises; and discovered to be, at great human cost, wholly false.”—Paul Johnson, *The Recovery of Freedom*

## Results
Thursday, 12 November 2020

“We can view results as a threat, or see them as an opportunity. It depends on whether we’re defending a little-understood status quo or seeking to make things work better.”—Seth Godin, [*The Gift of Results*](https://seths.blog/2020/11/the-gift-of-results/)

## Freedom
Wednesday, 11 November 2020

“I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.”—Robert A. Heinlein, *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*

## Efficiency
Sunday, 08 November 2020

“If you’re efficient, you’re doing it the wrong way. The right way is the hard way. The show was successful because I micromanaged it—every word, every line, every take, every edit, every casting. That’s my way of life.”—[Jerry Seinfeld](https://hbr.org/2017/01/lifes-work-jerry-seinfeld%E2%80%8B), *Harvard Business Review* interview

## Simple Brains
Tuesday, 03 November 2020

“If the brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t.”—Emerson Pugh

## Brilliance
Monday, 02 November 2020

“Amateurs tend to focus on seeking brilliance. Professionals often know that it’s far more effective to avoid stupidity. Side-stepping typical blunders is the simplest way to get ahead of the crowd.”—[Rosie Leizrowice](https://fs.blog/2020/11/common-probability-errors/)

## The Past or Why Study History
Friday, 30 October 2020

“...since men have no more ready corrective of conduct than knowledge of the past”—Polybius, *Histories*, 1.1.1-4

## To know, but not to seek
Wednesday, 28 October 2020

“Am I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I’d find that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I’d have time to work that out?”—J.K. Rowling, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*

## Being Sad
Wednesday, 28 October 2020


“We all want to do something to mitigate the pain of loss or to turn grief into something positive, to find a silver lining in the clouds. But I believe there is real value in just standing there, being still, being sad.”—John Green

## Elephants
Friday, 23 October 2020

“I remember my friend Johnny von Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.”–Enrico Fermi, quoted by Freeman Dyson, [*A meeting with Enrico Fermi*](https://www.nature.com/articles/427297a)

## The Ideal Subject
Friday, 23 October 2020

“The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist.”—Hannah Arendt, *The Origins of Totalitarianism*

## Tyrants’ Fear
Friday, 23 October 2020

“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!”—J.K. Rowling, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*

## Lies and Truth
Friday, 23 October 2020

“The result of a consistent and total substitution of lies for factual truth is not that the lie will now be accepted as truth and truth be defamed as a lie, but that the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world—and the category of truth versus falsehood is among the mental means to this end - is being destroyed.”—Hannah Arendt

## Secure System
Friday, 23 October 2020

“The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards.”—Gene Spafford

Similar to the expectation that, whatever you’ve done to secure your outward-facing network, the bad buys have penetrated it and do all the extra, expensive work to secure individual machines and data appropriately (which, in my experience, almost nobody is willing to do). IOW, you’re never paranoid enough in today’s world.

## Wasted
Sunday, 18 October 2020

“The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time”—Bertrand Russell

## Fools
Monday, 5 October 2020

“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person too fool.”—Richard Feynman

## Decomposition
Sunday, 4 October 2020

“The standard process of organizing knowledge by departments, and subdepartments, and further breaking it up into separate courses, tends to conceal the homogeneity of knowledge, and at the same time to omit much which falls between the courses.”—Richard Hamming

A technique useful in software development, less so in other fields.

## Irate
Thursday, 24 September 2020

“Only the person who becomes irate without reason, sins. Whoever becomes irate for a just reason is not guilty. Because, if ire were lacking, the science of God would not progress, judgments would not be sound, and crimes would not be repressed.

“Further, the person who does not become irate when he has cause to be, sins. For an unreasonable patience is the hotbed of many vices: it fosters negligence, and stimulates not only the wicked, but above all the good, to do wrong.”—St. John Chrysostom, *Homily XI super Matheum, 1c, nt.7*

## Humility
Tuesday, 22 September 2020

"Humility, therefore, is absolutely necessary if man is to avoid acting like a baby all his life. To grow up means, in fact, to become humble, to throw away the illusion that I am at the center of everything and that other people only exist to provide me with comfort and pleasure."—Thomas Merton, *Seeds of Contemplation*

## Socialism
Monday, 21 September 2020

“One sometimes gets the impression that the mere words ‘Socialism’ and ‘Communism’ draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, ‘Nature Cure’ quack, pacifist and feminist in England.”—George Orwell

## Curiosity
Friday, 18 September 2020

“But a curiosity of my type remains after all the most agreeable of all vices—sorry, I meant to say: the love of truth has its reward in heaven and even on earth.”—Nietzsche, *Beyond Good and Evil*

## Dictatorship
Wednesday, 16 September 2020

“Nobody every recommended a dictatorship aiming at ends other than those he himself approved. He who advocates dictatorship always advocates the unrestricted rule of his own will.“—Ludwig Von Mises

## Activism
Wednesday, 16 September 2020

“Activism is a way for useless people to feel important, even if the consequences of their activism are counterproductive for those they claim to be helping and damaging to the fabric of society as a whole.”—Thomas Sowell

## Cruel Reality
Monday, 14 September 2020

“History has the cruel reality of a nightmare, and the grandeur of man consists in his making beautiful and lasting works out of the real substance of that nightmare. Or, to put it another way, it consists in transforming the nightmare into vision; in freeing ourselves from the shapeless horror of reality—if only for an instant—by means of creation.”—Octavio Paz, *The Labyrinth of Solitude and Other Writings*

## Violence
Saturday, 12 September 2020

“If you are not prepared to use force to defend civilization, then be prepared to accept barbarism.”—Thomas Sowell

## Debased Eras (like today)
Wednesday, 09 September 2020

“In debased eras like today’s you can’t speak with a straight face of such notions as honor or integrity (or just about any other quality of character that rises above the basest and most self-serving of human instincts). You have to express yourself ironically or with a certain bitter and self-distancing knowingness and despair. You certainly can’t put words into a contemporary character’s mouth that take seriously such notions as nobility or rectitude.”—[Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/historical-fiction-1/)

## Doubt or Certainty
Monday, 07 September 2020

“It is not doubt but certainty that drives you mad.”—Friedrich Nietzsche, *Why I Am So Wise*

## Simplicity
Sunday, 06 September 2020

“Simplicity is the end result of long, hard work; not the starting point.”—Frederick Maitland

## Teaching History
Sunday, 06 September 2020

“History isn’t just something that ought to be taught or ought to be read or ought to be encouraged because it’s going to make us a better citizen. It will make us a better citizen; or because it will make us a more thoughtful and understanding human being, which it will; or because it will cause us to behave better, which it will. It should be taught for pleasure: The pleasure of history, like art or music or literature, consists of an expansion of the experience of being alive, which is what education is largely about.”—David McCullough

## This is what you shall do
Friday, 04 September 2020

“This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.”—Walt Whitman, *Leaves of Grass, preface*

## Apocalypse
Friday, 28 August 2020

“I had not been prepared for just how stupid the apocalypse would be, how obscene, how inane.”—[William Tychonievich](https://narrowdesert.blogspot.com/2020/08/not-with-bang.html)

## Creativity
Friday, 28 August 2020

“Creativity is intelligence having fun.”—Albert Einstein

## Tools
Wednesday, 26 August 2020

“There are two ranges in the growth of tools: the range within which machines are used to extend human capability and the range in which they are used to contract, eliminate, or replace human functions. In the first, man as an individual can exercise authority on his own behalf and therefore assume responsibility. In the second, the machine takes over—first reducing the range of choice and motivation in both the operator and the client, and second imposing its own logic and demand on both. Survival depends on establishing procedures which permit ordinary people to recognize these ranges and to opt for survival in freedom, to evaluate the structure built into tools and institutions so they can exclude those which by their structure are destructive, and control those which are useful.”—Ivan Illich, *Tools for Conviviality* (1973)

## The relativity of time
Tuesday, 25 August 2020

“Two things are true simultaneously: We’re running out of time. We have too much time on our hands.

“How can we be at a deadline and bored at the same time? We always are.

“Our experience of time relates to engagement, fear, opportunity and the culture.”—Seth Godin

## Deception
Monday, 24 August 2020

“It is as easy to deceive oneself without perceiving it as it is difficult to deceive others without their perceiving it.”—François duc de La Rochefoucauld, *Maximes* (1664)

## Partnership
Sunday, 23 August 2020

“A horrible suspicion that has sometimes haunted me is that the Conservative and the Progressive are secretly in partnership. That the quarrel they keep up in public is a put-up job, and that the way they perpetually play into each other’s hands is not an everlasting coincidence.”—G.K. Chesterton

“The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.”—G.K. Chesterton

## Books
Sunday, 23 August 2020

“Thank God for books as an alternative to conversation.”—W. H. Auden

## Truth
Sunday, 23 August 2020

“The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it.”—Flannery O’Connor

## Empire
Wednesday, 19 August 2020

“If we look at this conflict as a straight eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between Empire and those of us who are resisting it, it might seem that we are losing. But there is another way of looking at it. We, all of us gathered here, have, each in our own way, laid siege to Empire. We may not have stopped it in its tracks—yet—but we have stripped it down. We have made it drop its mask. We have forced it into the open. It now stands before us on the world’s stage in all its brutish, iniquitous nakedness.

“Our strategy should be not only to confront empire, but to lay siege to it. To deprive it of oxygen. To shame it. To mock it. With our art, our music, our literature, our stubbornness, our joy, our brilliance, our sheer relentlessness—and our ability to tell our own stories. Stories that are different from the ones we’re being brainwashed to believe. The corporate revolution will collapse if we refuse to buy what they are selling—their ideas, their version of history, their wars, their weapons, their notion of inevitability. Remember this: We be many and they be few. They need us more than we need them.”—Arundhati Roy, *War Talk*

## Boring
Monday, 17 August 2020

“Every kind of writing is good save that which bores.”—Voltaire, preface to *L’Enfant prodigue* (1736)

## GTD
Sunday, 16 August 2020

“Pretend your brain is a white board. Is it covered with to-do lists and ‘DO NOT ERASE’? Is there space for drawing and combining ideas?”—Jessica Kerr

## Emacs
Saturday, 15 August 2020

“GNU Emacs, which is a sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating system, and the International Space Station. It’s a bit tricky to explain, but in a nutshell, Emacs is a platform written in 1976 (yes, almost half a century ago) for writing software to make you more productive, masquerading as a text editor.”—[Steve Yegge](https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc)

## Bad Lovin’
Wednesday, 12 August 2020

“To summarize, then, we have four main points: First, love is primarily a matter of will rather than passion. Second, pleasant feelings are therefore not of its essence, even if they are usually associated with it. Third, love is a matter of willing what is good for the beloved. Fourth, love of another for his own sake has priority over love of another merely for some benefit he provides.”—[Edward Feser](https://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2016/07/bad-lovin.html)


## Editing
Thursday, 06 August 2020

“Remedies for Growth. The human thing is gardening, pruning. Nature is shameless & profligate, our job is editorial. We don’t tell it to grow; we tell it where, and where not to.”—David Warren

## Dementia
Thursday, 06 August 2020

“*Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat*. [Whom the gods would destroy they first drive mad.] … Dementia: loss of memory, history, & therefore of a future. That is our difficulty: we are all demented now.”—[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2020/08/06/ignore-gentle-reader/)

## Achievement
Friday, 31 July 2020

“To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time.”—Leonard Bernstein

## The Brain
Wednesday, 29 July 2020

“The brain being indeed a machine, we must not hope to find its artifice through other ways than those which are used to find the artifice of the other machines. It thus remains to do what we would do for any other machine; I mean to dismantle it piece by piece and to consider what these can do separately and together.”—Nicolaus Steno, *On the Brain*, 1669

## Anti-Authoritarian
Tuesday, 28 July 2020

“Anti-authoritarians question whether an authority is a legitimate one before taking that authority seriously. Evaluating the legitimacy of authorities includes assessing whether or not authorities actually know what they are talking about, are honest, and care about those people who are respecting their authority. And when anti-authoritarians assess an authority to be illegitimate, they challenge and resist that authority—sometimes aggressively and sometimes passive-aggressively, sometimes wisely and sometimes not.”—[Bruce Levine, PhD](https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/)

## Unhappiness=Error
Monday, 27 July 2020

“For whenever a man in any way loses self-control, or is struck down by misfortune, or grows angry, or loses heart, he shows in this way that he finds things different than what he expected, and consequently he lived under a mistake.”—Arthur Schopenauer, *The World as Will and Representation*

## Happiness=Expectation-Reality
Monday, 27 July 2020

“All happiness depends on the proportion of what we claim and what we receive. It is immaterial how great or small the two quantities of this proportion are, and the proportion can be established just as well by diminishing the first quantity as by increasing the second.”—Arthur Schopenauer, *The World as Will and Representation*

## Systems
Thursday, 23 July 2020

“The tragic reality is that very few sustainable systems are designed or applied by those who hold power, and the reason for this is obvious and simple: to let people arrange their own food, energy and shelter is to lose economic and political control over them. We should cease to look to power structures, hierarchical systems, or governments to help us, and devise ways to help ourselves.”—Bill Mollison

## Slave
Friday, 17 July 2020

“The oldest written history of the Slavs can be shortly summarised—myriads of slave hunts and the enthralment of entire peoples. The Slav was the most prized of human goods. With increased strength outside his marshy land of origin, hardened to the utmost against all privation, industrious, content with little, good-humoured, and cheerful, he filled the slave markets of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It must be remembered that for every Slavonic slave who reached his destination, at least ten succumbed to inhuman treatment during transport and to the heat of the climate. Indeed Ibrāhīm (tenth century), himself in all probability a slave dealer, says: ‘And the Slavs cannot travel to Lombardy on account of the heat which is fatal to them.’ Hence their high price.

“The Arabian geographer of the ninth century tells us how the Magyars in the Pontus steppe dominated all the Slavs dwelling near them. The Magyars made raids upon the Slavs and took their prisoners along the coast to Kerkh where the Byzantines came to meet them and gave Greek brocades and such wares in exchange for the prisoners.”—*The Cambridge Medieval History,* Vol. II, 1913

## Entrepreneurial Science
Friday, 17 July 2020

“Just as we have established a tradition of double-blinded research to determine drug efficacy, we must institute double-blinded research in other policy areas as well. Certainly the increased use of computer models, such as GCMs, cries out for the separation of those who make the models from those who verify them. The fact is that the present structure of science is entrepreneurial, with individual investigative teams vying for funding from organizations which all too often have a clear stake in the outcome of the research—or appear to, which may be just as bad. This is not healthy for science.”—Michael Crichton, *Aliens Cause Global Warming*, Caltech Michelin Lecture, 17 January, 2003

## System
Thursday, 16 July 2020

“I must create a system or be enslaved by another man’s.”—William Blake

## Pity
Wednesday, 15 July 2020

“We may have uneasy sensations from seeing a creature in distress, without pity; for we have not pity unless we wish to relieve them.”—Samuel Johnson 

“Pity is one form of being convinced that someone else is in pain.”—Ludwig Wittgenstein

“The name of this intense, pure, disinterested, gratuitous, generous attention is love.”—Simone Weil

## Holy Duties
Wednesday, 15 July 2020

“The burning conviction that we have a holy duty toward others is often a way of attaching our drowning selves to a passing raft. What looks like giving a hand is often a holding on for dear life. Take away our holy duties and you leave our lives puny and meaningless. There is no doubt that in exchanging a self-centered for a selfless life we gain enormously in self-esteem. The vanity of the selfless, even those who practice utmost humility, is boundless.”—Eric Hoffer, *The True Believer*

## Momisms
Monday, 13 July 2020

If we hadn’t told my brother Stumpy not to clean out the wood chipper by hand, we’d still be calling him Edward.

The cat can have kittens in the oven.  That doesn’t make them biscuits.

She was a tall girl.  She was so tall she could hunt geese with a rake.

## Julian of Norwich
Monday, 13 July 2020

“But our Lord said to me, ‘I am the ground of thy beseechings: first, it is My will that thou have it; and then I make thee to wish for it; and then I make thee to beseech it, and thou beseechest it. How then should it be that thou shouldest not have thy beseeching?’ … For it is most impossible that we should beseech mercy and grace and not have it. For all things that our good Lord maketh us to beseech, Himself hath ordained them to us from without beginning. Here may we see that our beseeching is not the cause of God’s goodness; and that showed He soothfastly in all these sweet words which He saith: ‘I am the ground.’ And our good Lord willeth that this be known of His lovers in earth; and the more that we know it the more should we beseech, if it be wisely taken; and so is our Lord’s meaning. Merry and joyous is our Lord of our prayer, and He looketh for it; and He willeth to have it; because with His grace He would have us like to Himself in condition as we are in kind. Therefore saith He to us ‘Pray inwardly, although thou think it has no savour to thee: for it is profitable, though thou feel not, though thou see not, yea, though thou think thou canst not.’”—Julian of Norwich

## Remembered
Saturday, 11 July 2020

“What has been done, thought, written, or spoken is not culture; culture is only that fraction which is remembered.”—Gary Taylor, *The Clock of the Long Now*

## Love
Friday, 10 July 2020

“It doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like, so long as somebody loves you.”—Roald Dahl, *The Witches*

## Memories
Friday, 10 July 2020

“Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.”—Haruki Murakami, *Kafka on the Shore*

## Trust
Tuesday, 07 July 2020

“We are often told to trust in God, and many of us have counseled others who are anxious or downcast to do so. But what does that mean?

“In some cases, when people give this counsel they mean this: Don’t worry, God will eventually give you what want. God will come around to your way of thinking at some point. Hang in there and wait for God to answer (your way). He’ll take care of things (in a way that pleases you).

“This is not trust.

“To trust is to move to the stable conviction that whatever God decides to do is the right thing. It means being at peace with what He does, what He decides. It is to accept that God often acts in paradoxical ways, in ways that are different from, or even contrary to, our notions of what is best. God often permits evils for some greater good, even if this greater good is hidden from us.”—[Msgr. Charles Pope](http://blog.adw.org/2020/07/what-does-it-mean-to-trust-in-god/)

## Mastery
Monday, 06 July 2020

“Once you start with openings, there is no way out… It is a little like developing the habit of stealing the test from your teacher’s desk instead of learning how to do the math. You may pass the test, but you learn absolutely nothing—and most critically, you don’t gain an appreciation for the value or beauty of learning itself.”—Josh Waitzkin, *Mastering the Fundamentals*

## Action
Sunday, 05 July 2020

“Simple as it seems, action is the cause, vehicle, and outcome of education. Perceptions, thoughts, ideas, memories, and intentions are important, but they are not the end product.”—James Zull, *From Brain to Mind: Using Neuroscience to Guide Change in Education*

## Oppression and Liberty
Friday, 03 July 2020

“Never has the individual been so completely delivered up to a blind collectivity, and never have men been less capable, not only of subordinating their actions to their thoughts, but even of thinking. Such terms as oppressors and oppressed, the idea of classes—all that sort of thing is near to losing all meaning, so obvious are the impotence and distress of all men in face of the social machine, which has become a machine for breaking hearts and crushing spirits, a machine for manufacturing irresponsibility, stupidity, corruption, slackness and, above all, dizziness. The reason for this painful state of affairs is perfectly clear. We are living in a world in which nothing is made to man’s measure; there exists a monstrous discrepancy between man’s body, man’s mind and the things which at present time constitute the elements of human existence; everything is in disequilibrium.”—Simone Weil, *Oppression and Liberty* (1955)

## Majority
Friday, 03 July 2020

“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.”—Mark Twain

## Fashions of Thought
Friday, 26 June 2020

“The use of fashions of thought is to distract men from their real dangers. We direct the fashionable outcry of each generation against those vices of which it is in the least danger, and fix its approval on the virtue that is nearest the vice which we are trying to make endemic. The game is to have them all running around with fire extinguishers whenever there’s a flood; and all crowding to that side of the boat which is already nearly gone under.”—C.S. Lewis, *The Screwtape Letters*

## Hardship
Monday, 22 June 2020

“Humans don’t mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it; what they mind is not feeling necessary. Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel necessary.”—Sebastian Junger

## Models
Friday, 19 June 2020

“Should some sort of post-mortem ever be conducted on the catastrophic failure of all computer models, it will be done with the help of a computer model, that will cost billions in whatever currency to assemble. It will show the need for more computer studies. And therefore, it will be catastrophically wrong.”—[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2020/06/19/a-note-on-sternutation/)

## Reality Is
Friday, 12 June 2020

“Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”—Philip K. Dick

## Unique
Thursday, 11 June 2020

“My generation is on the way out, and each death I have felt as an abruption, a tearing away of part of myself. There will be no one like us when we are gone, but then there is no one like anyone else, ever. When people die, they cannot be replaced. They leave holes that cannot be filled, for it is the fate—the genetic and neural fate—of every human being to be a unique individual, to find his own path, to live his own life, to die his own death.”—Oliver Sacks

## Suffering
Friday, 05 June 2020

“My argument with so much of psychoanalysis, is the preconception that suffering is a mistake, or a sign of weakness, or a sign even of illness. When in fact, possibly the greatest truths we know, have come out of people’s suffering. The problem is not to undo suffering, or to wipe it off the face of the earth, but to make it inform our lives, instead of trying to ‘cure’ ourselves of it constantly, and avoid it, and avoid anything but that lobotomized sense of what they call ‘happiness’. There’s too much of an attempt, it seems to me, to think in terms of controlling man, rather than freeing him—of defining him, rather than letting him go! It’s part of the whole ideology of this age, which is power-mad!”—Arthur Miller

## Success
Friday, 05 June 2020

“Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.”—Henry David Thoreau

## More Absurdity
Thursday, 04 June 2020

“So I hope you can accept Nature as She is—absurd.”—Richard Feynman, *QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter* (1985)

## Jacksonianism
Thursday, 28 May 2020

“The whole point of Jacksonianism is ‘You leave me alone and I’ll leave you alone. You play fair with me and I’ll play fair with you. But if you fuck with me, I’ll kill you.’”—Steven den Beste

## Straw Men
Tuesday, 26 May 2020

“The light obtained by setting straw men on fire is not what we mean by illumination.”—Adam Gopnik

## Hell Begins
Friday, 22 May 2020

“Hell begins with a grumbling mood, always complaining, always blaming others . . . but you are still distinct from it. You may even criticize it in yourself and wish you could stop it. But there may come a day when you can no longer. Then there will be no you left to criticize the mood or even to enjoy it, but just the grumble itself, going on forever like a machine. It is not a question of God “sending us” to hell. In each of us there is something growing, which will BE hell unless it is nipped in the bud.”—C.S. Lewis, *The Great Divorce*

## Stress or Passion
Friday, 15 May 2020

“Working hard for something we don't care about is called stress. Working hard for something we love is called passion.”—Simon Sinek

## A Good Side
Monday, 11 May 2020

“Does Political Correctness have a good side? Yes, it does, for it makes us re-examine attitudes, and that is always useful. The trouble is that, with all popular movements, the lunatic fringe so quickly ceases to be a fringe, the tail begins to wag the dog. For every woman or man who is quietly and sensibly using the idea to examine our assumptions, there are 20 rabble-rousers whose real motive is desire for power over others, no less rabble-rousers because they see themselves as anti-racists or feminists or whatever.”—Doris Lessing, *Language and the Lunatic Fringe* 1992

## Things Happen
Monday, 11 May 2020

“Things happen to a person; that is, life deals you a set of cards and you play them as you are able. If I do my best I can and make no trouble for my neighbors, then surely I cannot be blamed either for my existence or my government. There are forces that buffet us through life that no mere individual can withstand. Better to stick to my books and musings about literature and leave the government to those who know best. That was certainly what I believed for years, but this evening I had begun to wonder, foolishly perhaps, if it wasn't that sort of thinking which had helped bring about this current state of affairs.”—Stephen Dobyns, *The Two Deaths of Senora Puccini*

## Following in the footsteps of those that came before
Monday, 11 May 2020

“No matter how hard you try, you can’t.

“After just a few steps, you’ll be slightly enlarging the footprint. By the time six people have done it, the original is completely gone.

“Footprints might be a fine compass, but they’re not much of a map. That’s on us.”—[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2020/05/following-in-the-footsteps-of-those-that-came-before/)

## Mortality
Sunday, 10 May 2020

“The Church itself was regarded (and will continue to be regarded by its adherents) as immortal, but its administration is subject to perpetual threat of mortality, that is, of corruption and weakness tending to extinction.”—Hilaire Belloc, *The Crisis of Civilization*

## Tyranny
Friday, 08 May 2020

“The wisest thing in the world is to cry out before you are hurt. It is no good to cry out after you are hurt; especially after you are mortally hurt. People talk about the impatience of the populace; but sound historians know that most tyrannies have been possible because men moved too late. It is often essential to resist a tyranny before it exists.”—G. K. Chesterton, *Eugenics and Other Evils*


## Symbolic Logic
Thursday, 07 May 2020

“Man lives in a world of ideas. Any phenomenon is so complex that he cannot possibly grasp the whole of it. He abstracts certain characteristics of a given phenomenon as an idea, then represents that idea as a symbol, be it a word or a mathematical sign. Human reaction is almost entirely reaction to symbols, and only negligibly to phenomena. As a matter of fact,” he continued, removing the cigarette holder from his mouth and settling into his subject, “it can be demonstrated that the human mind can think only in terms of symbols.”

“When we think, we let symbols operate on other symbols in certain, set fashions—rules of logic, or rules of mathematics. If the symbols have been abstracted so that they are structurally similar to the phenomena they stand for, and if the symbol operations are similar in structure and order to the operations of phenomena in the real world, we think sanely. If our logic-mathematics, or our word-symbols, have been poorly chosen, we think not sanely.”—Robert A. Heinlein, *The Past Through Tomorrow* p. 10

## Meaning
Thursday, 07 May 2020

(Paraphrasing and elaborating on something Bernardo Kastrup said)
“The great taboo in science is not that there is magic (no one cares that the big bang is supposed to have magically come from nothing, or that mental processes like mathematics magically map onto the physical world so perfectly).

No, science is fine with all that. The great taboo in our scientistic world view is the idea that there could be meaning to it all!”

## Questioning
Saturday, 02 May 2020

“It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known but to question it.”—Jacob Bronowski, *The Ascent of Man*

## Rich Anarchists
Saturday, 02 May 2020

“So you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question. You’ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor. Why should it? The poor have been rebels, but they have never been anarchists; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government. The poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man hasn’t; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists.”—G. K. Chesterton, *The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare*

## Covenant
Thursday, 30 April 2020

We thought we ranked above the chance of ill.<br/>
Others might fall, not we, for we were wise—<br/>
Merchants in freedom. So, of our free-will<br/>
We let our servants drug our strength with lies.<br/>
The pleasure and the poison had its way<br/>
On us as on the meanest, till we learned<br/>
That he who lies will steal, who steals will slay.<br/>
Neither God's judgment nor man's heart was turned.<br/>

Yet there remains His Mercy--to be sought<br/>
Through wrath and peril till we cleanse the wrong<br/>
By that last right which our forefathers claimed<br/>
When their Law failed them and its stewards were bought.<br/>
This is our cause. God help us, and make strong<br/>
Our will to meet Him later, unashamed!—Rudyard Kipling

## Unbearable
Wednesday, 29 April 2020

“Some things you must always be unable to bear. Some things you must never stop refusing to bear. Injustice and outrage and dishonor and shame. No matter how young you are or how old you have got. Not for kudos and not for cash: your picture in the paper nor money in the bank either. Just refuse to bear them.”—William Faulkner, *Intruder in the Dust*

## A Day
Monday, 27 April 2020

“Every separate day in the year is a gift presented to only one man—the happiest one; all other people use his day, to enjoy the sunshine or berate the rain, never knowing, however, to whom that day really belongs; and its fortunate owner is pleased and amused by their ignorance. A person cannot foreknow which day exactly will fall to his lot, what trifle he will remember forever: the ripple of reflected sunlight on a wall bordering water or the revolving fall of a maple leaf; and it often happens that he recognizes his day only in retrospection, long after he has plucked, and crumpled, and chucked under his desk the calendar leaf with the forgotten figure.”—Vladimir Nabokov, from “The Potato Elf,” The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov (Vintage, 1997)

## Water
Saturday, 25 April 2020

“There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet
an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says
‘Morning, boys. How's the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a
bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes
‘What the hell is water?’”—David Foster Wallace, *Kenyon College Commencement Address*, May 21, 2005

## They also serve
Friday, 24 April 2020

When I consider how my light is spent</br>
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,</br>
And that one talent which is death to hide</br>
Lodg’d with me useless, though my soul more bent</br>
To serve therewith my Maker, and present</br>
My true account, lest he returning chide;</br>
“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”</br>
I fondly ask. But Patience to prevent</br>
That murmur, soon replies: “God doth not need</br>
Either man's work or his own gifts; who best</br>
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state</br>
Is kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed</br>
And post o'er land and ocean without rest:</br>
They also serve who only stand and wait.”</br>
—John Milton, *When I Consider How My Light is Spent*

## Good and Evil
Thursday, 23 April 2020

“The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.”—Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

## Greatest Trick
Thursday, 23 April 2020

“The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist”—Charles Baudelaire

## Coincidence
Wednesday, 22 April 2020

“Coincidence can be interpreted, even spun. Back in 1777, Horace Walpole announced that ‘what is called chance is the instrument of Providence.’ Théophile Gautier called chance God’s pseudonym, and Doris Lessing supposedly said that ‘coincidences are God’s way of remaining anonymous’—though the quote is often hopefully (or impishly) misattributed to Albert Einstein. The legendary editor Sol Stein put it this way: ‘If you think something is a coincidence, you don’t know how God works. Pay attention. He doesn’t have time to give you private lessons.’”—Jeanette Cooperman, [*Making Sense of a Random Universe*](https://commonreader.wustl.edu/making-sense-of-a-random-universe/)

## Old Books
Saturday, 11 April 2020 (Holy Saturday)

“It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between. If that is too much for you, you should at least read one old one to every three new ones.”–C. S. Lewis, Introduction to Athanasius’ *On the Incarnation*

## Never Defined
Friday, 10 April 2020 (Good Friday)

“It’s so important that we never be defined by tragedy. Shaped by it, but never defined.”—Amanda Holden, on *Britain’s Got Talent*, 2018 Week 2

## Dreaming
Monday, 06 April 2020

“Every one of us is like a man who sees things in a dream and thinks that he knows them perfectly and then wakes up to find that he knows nothing.”–Plato, *Statesman* quoted in Hannah Arendt, *The Life of the Mind*

## Solitude
Monday, 06 April 2020

“Thinking, existentially speaking, is a solitary but not a lonely business; solitude is that human situation in which I keep myself company. Loneliness comes about … when I am alone without being able to split up into the two-in0one, without being able to keep myself company.”—Hannah Arendt, *The Life of the Mind*

## Admission of Uncertainty
Saturday, 04 April 2020

“[...] it is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.”—Richard Feynman, *John Danz Lecture* 1963

## By His Lights
Friday, 03 April 2020

“I don't quite know what we're doing on this insignificant cinder spinning away in a dark corner of the universe. That is a secret which the high gods have not confided in me. Yet one thing I believe and I believe it with every fiber of my being. A man must live by his lights and do what little he can and do it as best as he can.”—Walker Percy

## Scientific Truth
Friday, 03 April 2020

“No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles, nor to prescribe in any way the character of the questions investigated. Neither may a government determine the aesthetic value of artistic creations, nor limit the forms of literacy or artistic expression. Nor should it pronounce on the validity of economic, historic, religious, or philosophical doctrines. Instead it has a duty to its citizens to maintain their freedom, to let those citizens contribute to the further adventure and the development of the human race.”—Richard Feynman

## Common Sense
Friday, 03 April 2020

“The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable, what then?”—George Orwell *1984*

## Progress
Friday, 27 March 2020

“Believing in progress does not mean believing that any progress has yet been made”—Franz Kafka


## Cures
Friday, 27 March 2020

“If people offer many remedies for an illness, you may be sure it is incurable”—Anton Chekhov

## Anything
Friday, 27 March 2020

“Anything can happen, but it usually doesn’t”—Robert Benchley


## Truth
Friday, 27 March 2020

“You shall know the truth, and it will make you odd”—Flannery O'Connor



## Hope
Friday, 27 March 2020

“Hope is patience with the lamp lit”—Tertullian

## Consciousness
Sunday, 22 March 2020

“Why do you insist the universe is not a conscious intelligence, when it gives birth to conscious intelligences?”—Cicero, c. 44 B.C.

## The Birthday of Eternity
Sunday, 22 March 2020

“The day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of eternity.”—Lucius Annaeus Seneca, *De Brevitate Vitae* c. 48 A.D.

## Honeybees
Sunday, 15 March 2020

“We are the bees of the Invisible. Passionately, we plunder the honey of the visible, in order to gather it in the great golden hive of the Invisible.”—Rainer Maria Rilke, from a letter to his friend Witold Hulewicz, 1925. [Seen here](https://theoriapress.wordpress.com/publications/face-to-face-with-invisible-honeybees/)

## Notes
Thursday, 12 March 2020

“Notes aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.”—Richard P. Feynman

## Science
Thursday, 12 March 2020

“Science is what we do to keep us from lying to ourselves.”—Richard P. Feynman

## Belief
Sunday, 08 March 2020

“I should like to report here an experience I had during my last trip to this country, when I visited a world-famous scientist whom I had known from Europe. He received me on the porch of his house which was adorned with a horse shoe. I tried to make a funny remark by saying, “But Professor, you don’t believe in that sort of thing, do you really?” whereupon he answered quite naively, “Of course not, but you know I have been told that it works even when you don't believe in it.”—Carl Alfred Meier

## Teachers
Saturday, 07 March 2020

“The old dealt with its pupils as grown birds when they teach them to fly; the new deals with them more as the poultry-keeper deals with young birds... In a word, the old was a kind of propagation—men transmitting manhood to men; the new is merely propaganda.”—C.S. Lewis, *The Abolition of Man* p.32-33

## What Life Is All About
Sunday, 01 March 2020

“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don’t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn’t stop you from doing anything at all.”—Richard P. Feynman

## Burdening Flow of Information
Saturday, 29 February 2020

“Because instant and credible information has to be given, it becomes necessary to resort to guesswork, rumors and suppositions to fill in the voids, and none of them will ever be rectified, they will stay on in the readers' memory. How many hasty, immature, superficial and misleading judgments are expressed every day, confusing readers, without any verification. The press can both simulate public opinion and miseducate it. Thus we may see terrorists heroized, or secret matters, pertaining to one's nation's defense, publicly revealed, or we may witness shameless intrusion on the privacy of well-known people under the slogan: ‘everyone is entitled to know everything.’ But this is a false slogan, characteristic of a false era: people also have the right not to know, and it is a much more valuable one. The right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip, nonsense, vain talk. A person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information.”—Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, *[A World Split Apart](https://www.solzhenitsyncenter.org/a-world-split-apart)* (1978 Harvard Commencement Address)

## Saints’ Biographies
Saturday, 29 February 2020

“If the biographers of the saints would write of their defects as well as of their virtues, their biographies would be longer.” So said Saint Alphonsus de Liguori to one of his novices.—[David Warren](https://www.davidwarrenonline.com/2020/02/28/a-look-inside/)

## Imagination and Will
Friday, 28 February 2020

“Collecting facts is important. Knowledge is important. But if you don’t have an imagination to use the knowledge, civilization is nowhere. Love what you do and do what you love. Don’t listen to anyone else who tells you not to do it. You do what you want, what you love. Imagination should be the center of your life. We are the miracle of force and matter making itself over into imagination and will. Incredible. The Life Force experimenting with forms. You for one. Me for another. The Universe has shouted itself alive. We are one of the shouts.”—Ray Bradbury

## For Your Own Good
Friday, 21 February 2020

“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”—C.S. Lewis

## Truth
Saturday, 15 February 2020

“Once you can sincerely say: ‘I don’t know’ then it becomes possible to get at the truth.”—Robert A. Heinlein, *The cat who walks through walls*

“Dear G-d: lead me in the company of those who seek truth and spare me from those who have found it.”—(attributed to André Gide)

Friday, 14 February 2020

“The dead outnumber the living fourteen to one, and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril.”—Niall Ferguson

“History never repeats itself. Man always does.”—Voltaire

## Luck
Saturday, 08 February 2020

“If someone has consistently good luck, it ain’t luck.”—Zvi Mowshowitz, [Moloch Hasn’t Won](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/moloch-hasnt-won/) 

## Conversation
Friday, 07 February 2020

“[This argument] fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.”—Neil Postman, *Amusing Ourselves to Death*

## Education and Training
Friday, 07 February 2020

“Education is what, when, and why to do things. Training is how to do it.

“In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it. In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.”—Richard Hamming, *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* (1997)

See also [You and Your Research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)

## Fully Automatic Model
Monday, 03 February 2020

“The world-conquering West of the nineteenth century needed a philosophy of life in which realpolitik—victory for the tough people who face the bleak facts—was the guiding principle. Thus the bleaker the facts you face, the tougher you seem to be. So we vied with each other to make the Fully Automatic Model of the universe as bleak as possible.”—Bernardo Kastrup, *More Than Allegory: On Religious Myth, Truth and Belief*

## Beasts
Monday, 03 February 2020

“The beasts of modernism have mutated into the beasts of postmodernism—relativism into nihilism, amorality into immorality, irrationality into insanity, sexual deviancy into polymorphous perversity. And since then, generations of intelligent students under the guidance of their enlightened professors have looked into the abyss, have contemplated those beasts, and have said, “How interesting, how exciting.”—Gertrude Himmelfarb, *On Looking into the Abyss* (1994)

## Course of Study
Saturday, 01 February 2020

“I would not advise a rigid adherence to a particular plan of study . . . . A man ought to read just as inclination leads him, for what he reads as a task will do him little good.”–James Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson*, quoting Johnson

## Learned Lumber
Saturday, 01 February 2020

“The bookish blockhead, ignorantly read,

With loads of learned lumber in his head.”—Alexander Pope, *Essay on Criticism* (1711)

## Common Sense, Hedonistic World-view
Monday, 27 January 2020

“By contrast, Hitler is a criminal lunatic... yet Hitler has an army of millions of men, aeroplanes in thousands, tanks in tens of thousands. For his sake a great nation has been willing to overwork itself for six years and then to fight for two years more, whereas for the common-sense, essentially hedonistic world-view which Mr. Wells puts forward, hardly a human creature is willing to shed a pint of blood.”—George Orwell, *[Wells, Hitler and the world State](https://orwell.ru/library/reviews/wells/english/e_whws)* (1941)

## Physics Is
Friday, 24 January 2020

“The first step is to reject the misguided belief that ‘everything is physical’, and replace it with a much more humble—but true—thesis: only observation is physical. Physics is the science of observation.”—[Adur Alkain](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2020/01/guest-essay-marriage-of-physics-and_24.html)

Which is to say, save the appearances?

## Bodies
Friday, 24 January 2020

“Man has no Body distinct from his soul; for that called Body is a portion of a Soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.”—William Blake, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

## Prudence
Wednesday, 22 January 2020

“An ounce of prudence is worth a pound of cleverness.”—Baltasar Gracian (1601-1658)

## Escape
Wednesday, 22 January 2020

“The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.”—Marcus Aurelius

## Opinion Ghettos
Wednesday, 22 January 2020

“People are only your friends in opinion ghettos as long as you agree with them.”-[James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/i-dont-give-a-s/)

## Tools
Monday, 20 January 2020

“A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others. People feel joy, as opposed to mere pleasure, to the extent that their activities are creative; while the growth of tools beyond a certain point increases regimentation, dependence, exploitation, and impotence.”—Ivan Illich, *Tools for Conviviality* (1973)

## Breakdown
Friday, 17 January 2020

“Cultures spring from religions; ultimately the vital force which maintains any culture is its philosophy, its attitude toward the universe; the decay of a religion involves the decay of the culture corresponding to it—we see that most clearly in the breakdown of Christendom today.”—Hilaire Belloc: *The Great Heresies*

## Eyore
Thursday, 16 January 2020

“Eeyore’s pessimism is the expression of inadequacy and fear. I distinguish the right kind of pessimism, which means simply recognizing the deep incompetence of human nature, from the wrong kind, which tells us to stop hoping.”—Roger Scruton,  (27 February 1944 – 12 January 2020)

## Perfection
Thursday, 16 January 2020

“It seems that perfection is finally attained, not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.”—Antoine de Saint-Exupery, *Terre des Hommes* (1939)

## Vain Hope
Monday, 13 January 2020

“The hope that new experiments will lead us back to objective events in time and space is about as well founded as the hope of discovering the end of the world in the unexplored regions of the Antarctic.”—Werner Heisenberg, quoted in Nick Herbert, *Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics*

## Natural Science
Monday, 13 January 2020

“Natural science does not simply describe and explain nature; it is part of the interplay between nature and ourselves; it describes nature as exposed to our method of questioning.”—Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science* (1959)

## Absurdity
Monday, 13 January 2020

“I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be as absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?”—Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science* (1958)

## Evil
Monday, 13 January 2020

“The evil man destroys even himself.”—Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*

## Atoms
Monday, 13 January 2020

“According to Democritus, atoms had lost the qualities like colour, taste, etc., they only occupied space, but geometrical assertions about atoms were admissible and required no further analysis. In modern physics, atoms lose this last property, they possess geometrical qualities in no higher degree than colour, taste, etc. The atom of modern physics can only be symbolized by a partial differential equation in an abstract multidimensional space. Only the experiment of an observer forces the atom to indicate a position, a colour and a quantity of heat. All the qualities of the atom of modern physics are derived, it has no immediate and direct physical properties at all, i.e. every type of visual conception we might wish to design is, *eo ipso*, faulty. An understanding of ‘the first order’ is, I would almost say by definition, impossible for the world of atoms.”—Werner Heisenberg, *Philosophic Problems of Nuclear Science*, trans. F. C. Hayes (1952)

“Atoms are neither things nor objects...atoms are part of observational situations.”—Werner Heisenberg, *Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations* (1972)



## Science
Monday, 13 January 2020

“I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but it is ghastly silent about all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously.”—Erwin Schrödinger, *Nature and the Greeks* (1954)

## Consciousness
Monday, 13 January 2020

“Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. Not only has none of us ever experienced more than one consciousness, but there is also no trace of circumstantial evidence of this ever happening anywhere in the world. If I say that there cannot be more than one consciousness in the same mind, this seems a blunt tautology–we are quite unable to imagine the contrary.”—Erwin Schrödinger, *The Arithmetical Paradox: The Oneness of Mind* in *What Is Life?* (1944)

“For thousands of years men have striven and suffered and begotten and woman have brought forth in pain. A hundred years ago, perhaps, another man sat on this spot; like you he gazed with awe and yearning in his heart at the dying light on the glaciers. Like you he was begotten of man and born of woman. He felt pain and brief joy as you do. Was he someone else? Was it not you yourself? What is this Self of yours? What was the necessary condition for making the thing conceived this time into you, just you and not someone else?”—Erwin Schrödinger, *Seek for the Road* (1925)

## Mere
Monday, 13 January 2020

“But my interest was drawn not only to the noun in the title of Bejan’s book but also to the adjective: mere. Her use of that word delighted me. Like a lover of endangered species, the lover of endangered words jumps for joy when he sees a word being rescued, and is grateful when a writer restores to currency a semantic possibility that had fallen into desuetude. It is as if a lovely antique table has been rediscovered after many years of gathering dust up in the attic, and when brought downstairs and cleaned up and polished, imparts a splendor and unbought grace to the room that no shiny new object could possibly match.”—[Wilfred M. McClay](https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/eating-and-being/articles/mere)

## Truth
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“Truth is not that which is demonstrable but that which is unavoidable.”—Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Commitment
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“At the moment of commitment the entire universe conspires to assist you.”—Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe

## Choosing Evil
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.”—Mary Wollstonecraft

## Precision
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“There’s no sense in being precise when you don’t even know what you’re talking about”—John Von Neumann (unsourced)

## Expression
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“I know more than I can express in words, and the little I can express would not have been expressed, had I not known more.”—Vladimir Nabokov, *Strong Opinions*

## Anger
Saturday, 11 January 2020

“To be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, in the right way—that is not easy.”—Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics*

## Editing
Wednesday, 08 January 2020

“A simple editing trick:

“Every sentence has a purpose. It doesn’t exist to take up space. It exists to change the reader, to move her from here to there.

“This sentence, then, what’s it for?

“If it doesn’t move us closer to where we seek to go, delete it.”—[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2020/01/what-is-this-sentence-supposed-to-do/)

## Madness
Saturday, 04 January 2020

“Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule.”—Nietzche

## Muggeridge’s Law
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“Satire can never compete with real life for its sheer absurdity.

“While Malcolm Muggeridge was the editor of Punch, it was announced that Khrushchev and Bulganin were coming to England. Muggeridge hit upon the idea of a mock itinerary, a lineup of the most ludicrous places the two paunchy pear-shaped little Soviet leaders could possibly be paraded through during the solemn process of a state visit. Shortly before press time, half the feature had to be scrapped. It coincided exactly with the official itinerary, just released, prompting Muggeridge to observe: ‘We live in an age in which it is no longer possible to be funny. There is nothing you can imagine, no matter how ludicrous, that will not promptly be enacted before your very eyes, probably by someone well known.’”—Tom Wolfe, “Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast: A literary manifesto for the new social novel”, *Harpers*, November, 1989

## Sowell’s Law
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“In human problems, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.”

## Sumner’s Law
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“The type and formula of most schemes of philanthropy or humanitarianism is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D. The radical vice of all these schemes, from a sociological point of view, is that C is not allowed a voice in the matter, and his position, character, and interests, as well as the ultimate effects on society through C’s interests, are entirely overlooked. […A and B] ignore entirely the source from which they must draw all the energy which they employ in their remedies, and they ignore all the effects on other members of society than the ones they have in view. […T]he State cannot get a cent for any man without taking it from some other man, and this latter must be a man [C] who has produced and saved it. This latter is the Forgotten Man.”—William Graham Sumner, *The Forgotten Man*

## Heinlein’s Dichotomy
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“Political tags—such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth—are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire.”—Robert A. Heinlein, *The notebooks of Lazarus Long*

## Cognitive Bias
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“Intelligent and educated people are less likely to learn from their mistakes, for instance, or take advice from others. And when they do err, they are better able to build elaborate arguments to justify their reasoning, meaning that they become more and more dogmatic in their views.”—David Robson, *The Intelligence Trap*

## Dysrationalia
Thursday, 02 January 2020

“We have an implicit [but wrong] assumption that intelligence and rationality go together—or else why would we be so surprised when smart people do foolish things?”

“I coined the term “dysrationalia” (analogous to “dyslexia”), meaning the inability to think and behave rationally despite having adequate intelligence, to draw attention to a large domain of cognitive life that intelligence tests fail to assess.”—[Keith E. Stanovich](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rational-and-irrational-thought-the-thinking-that-iq-tests-miss/)

## Practice It
Wednesday, 01 January 2020

“The Games sacred to Zeus were held every four years at the city of Olympia in Greece. The stadium is still there. You can walk through the tunnel that the athletes took to enter the arena and even wriggle your toes into the stone grooves that served in ancient times as starting blocks for the races.

“In those days, the spectators sat city-by-city. The Athenians took their seats all in one section. Same for the Corinthians, Argives, etc.

”The stadium was packed on this particular day, when an elderly gentleman entered seeking a seat.

“No one would get up for him.

“The old man crossed painfully through the Theban section. Nobody stood. The gentleman next entered the Achaean section; again no person vacated his seat. By now the full stadium had noticed the elderly fellow’s ordeal. They began jeering and mocking him. The man worked his way through the sections of two more cities. Still no one stood. The laughter and derision now dominated the entire field.

“The old man next stepped toward the Spartan section. As soon as his foot crossed the margin, every single Spartan stood, offering the gentleman his seat.

“At this, the entire stadium burst into applause. The ovation lasted for minutes. When the cheers finally died down, one spectator turned to his neighbor and observed, ‘See? The Greeks all know what is right. But only the Spartans practice it.’”—[Steven Pressfield](https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/01/2-notes-for-the-new-year/)
