** 07:20 Happy Canada Day!
** 07:38 Adriana asked about Craig - he’s been evacuated with the fire only a mile fron the trailer. On his way to Rawleen’s in Kamloops as of 2300.
** 12:17 Went to Mother Nature’s and got safflower seed, and to Giant for a card and gift bag, and to deposit my Canada Pension check. All the major backups are run and copied to the WDBook. Not yet copied to the offsite drives. Turning to RAC business now.
** 17:13 Think I’m ready for RAC. Had a nap, had a shower. Valerie talked with Craig again and with Ans. The /data backup is copied to WDBook and Offsite2, /media is copying to Media as I type.
** 19:09 Fed, cleaned-up, about ready for the RAC performance.
** 23:00 RAC went well, I’d say. Finished by 2100. Still have three tabled apps. Craig heard that his trailer survived the fire.

** 06:50 2335-0604, 5:53 81. 68F cloudy, forecast 81F some showers this morning. 44th Anniversary, Joe’s Birthday today.
** 09:33 Washed dishes and am boiling eggs. Valerie is planning to go to Aquafit in a bit. Downloaded a pdf of “Lisp in Small Pieces” and converted it to epub.
** 17:05 Washed delicates, Valerie is pleased with her perfume, I’m happy with the Magic Flute dvd and the plug converters for the Amsterdam trip. We’re off to dinner at PF Chang at 1800.
** 19:28 And we’re home. Valerie had tempura shrimp rolls, I had chicken pad thai. Very nice spring rolls to get started. Took a stroll around the mall, got an estimate to resize her ring, and so to home. She seems to have enjoyed it a lot.

** 07:08 2246-0538, 6:16 82. clear. 60F forecast 78 mostly clear with chance of showers in afternoon.
** 11:57 Fixed Valerie’s password file and ran her updates. Went for a walk and returned Mim’s drywall knives. Ate a bit of lunch and am ready to do some lawn work to honor the nice weather.
** 13:32 Dug up the remaining bush roots on the S side and turned-over a bit more of the upcoming garden ground. Enough to get me a bit puffed. Cooling off now.
** 22:53 A quiet afternoon, rain around 2100.

** 12:14 Back from church - morning prayer. Costco is closed, so we stopped at Giant for oat milk, cherries, lettuce and corn. Will have shrimp salad for dinner.
** 15:56 Bread in pans rising - new stools arrived, one is cracked, will see what Valerie wants to do.
** 21:17 Damaged stool returned to Target - they’ll ship another directly to the house. Made shrimp and avocado salad for dinner. Bread nturned out fine. Watched another GOT. Pumped up RF tire.

** 17:15 Mowed front and back. Agreed to take Bruce and his mower to Ellicott City for repairs Tuesday midday. Valerie’s knitting group meets at 1030 tomorrow in the carport. Miriam and the girls came by for a nice visit.
** 22:22 Good meeting, Carl’s 32nd anniversary and Rosslyn came.

** 06:36 2307-0558, 6:06 79. 68F light cloud, forecast 96F. Fitbit consistently fails to recognize that I’m awake/out of bed, because I walk around a little, then sit and meditate?
** 13:55 Right after the meeting I watered the deck plants and started the weeping hose. Cleaned out the carport and set up for the knitting group. Took Bruce to the Ellicott City Home Depot to drop off his lawn mower for repairs. It’s currently 94F.
** 21:07 Drove Valerie to the far side of Baltimore to pick up Japanese Willow branches to stick in water and, eventually, in the ground. She’s now working at warping her loom (instead of watching GOT). I attended the special OMCA Board meeting to interview two applicants for Board membership. Chances are either would be fine, I’m leaning toward the young woman since she grew up in and lives in the apartments and might be able to involve her neighbors in the community more.

** 10:21 Back from walking with Michael. 91F. Going to cool off a bit - upper to mid-80s through the weekend. Predicting a thunderstorm around 1400-1600 this afternoon - would be nice, but we’ll wait and see. Tired - missed evening meds last night and slept poorly, as usual in that circumstance.
** 11:07 Copied Zuby’s “20 Things” from Twitter and put on my website at zuby.html. Pointed to it by SDA yesterday.
** 22:23 Napped this afternoon, had Chinese shrimp with broccoli for dinner, watched a GOT. Fixed Valerie’s Kindle Fire to read epubs so she could read all the Jodi Taylor’s that we have.
