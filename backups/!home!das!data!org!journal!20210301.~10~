** 09:37 It was the code for Nigel’s meeting that was off - he gave the correct one during the speaker meeting that I didn’t attend.
** 10:24 Sitting on hold to get the delivery of Entresto arranged. 25 minutes or so and counting. At least the music is classical piano - Mozart, maybe Back, like that.
** 12:00 I’ve talked with one person, am now waiting to talk with the pharmacy. 
** 14:06 Still waiting - I’ve put the phone back on the charger - being on hold for 4 hours ate 45% of its power.
** 17:06 They came on line and took my phone number. Called back around 1615 - meds will be here Wednesday.

** 07:03 2316-0624, 6:24 82. Sunny and windy, 27F.
** 17:57 Spent some time organizing more of the War Story letters, added to the outline. Edited another chapter of Poetic Diction. We took a short walk. Plan to go to Mission BBQ or somewhere else and watch a movie tonight.
** 22:45 Ate Chinese, watched some more Harry Potter shorts, then the first Magritte epesode. Heavy, but very well done. Will want to look for Poirot - the ABC Murders with John Malkevich on Amazon Prime.

** 08:48 Good meeting - Alex gave a good lead. Trash is gone, RAC tomorrow, I should check it out today and start the minutes. Also send Adriana her birthday present ($) and arrange a card for Friday. Also ask Jackie about what Finn would like for his birthday.

** 06:57 2351-0551, 5:25 84. Up a little early to meet Ben Wolff between 0700-0730 to look at the gingko biloba out front.
** 08:28 Ben’s assessment is that the only solution is to remove it/her, and so the next step is to submit an application to the RAC. I’ll get that in today. His bill is $450, which is great. Much better than hauling berries all Fall.
** 10:20 Armando will do the yard for $475. Turns out that they do trees, too. Since the gingko is the last large tree that we’re likely to take, we’re not likely to get him to do that but we can recommend him. Must get the application in today.
** 12:32 Just sent the application off - bread is in the oven for the second proving. Half-hour to go.
** 15:55 Bread looks good. Walked to Parallel to look at the application there - they’d already done the work, so pfffft. Aiming for a nap now.
** 22:35 Woke with a bad headache. Mike was away so I led the RAC meeting - it went OK. Just got word that Mike’s dad passed last night.

** 07:17 2321-0632, 6:35 90. Yet another clear, bright, chilly (25F) morning. Valerie got up shortly after 0700 - early for her.
** 17:31 Did get gift and card to Iana and card to Sarah. Attended Nigel’s meeting at 1500 - which ran for 90 minutes, BTW.
** 19:48 Peacock Channel 7-day free trial - kootenay21 - to watch Harry Potter. $4.99/mo after.

** 07:16 0002-0643, 6:12 86. Was mostly awake after 0612 - or off and on at least. And yet another clear, sunny, chilly (25F) morning. Happy Saturday!
** 12:17 Valerie and I just got back from a trip to Lowes and Aldi. She didn’t find any hangers for the kitchen shelf, so that’s on hold.
** 22:15 We watched the Halfblood Prince after dinner.

** 19:49 Valerie is on a Zoom with her knitting friends. I made chicken chili. We took a short walk. She had an hour nap.

** 06:20 2327-0609, 5:58 83. Failed to take meds last evening, impacted my sleep again. Must be more careful yet. Clear, 21F.
** 11:34 updated modus-themes-20210304.1308 org-static-blog-20210222.1035 dash-20210228.2221
** 11:34 Valerie is doing Yoga. Met with Maria - I’ll take BP three or four times a week at various times and report in two weeks. I’ll get an order to do blood work in a month. We’ll meet at her office in three months. Might change dosage before then.
** 11:36 Met John outside - Brenda has had knee replacement, he has bad arthritis.
** 13:44 Playing with fonts in Modus Themes. Variable width DejaVu works ok but still working on sizes. (+ 70 70) is a bit too big for my taste (and monitors).
