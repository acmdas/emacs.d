** 14:02 Happy New Year! I neglected to start a 20210101 backup of the data drive, so I didn't begin this until it had finished (and I did a GNUCash backup and started the media backup). I slept well, 0033-0857, 7:49 90. Michael S. called - second day in a row. Valerie suggested that we replace the mattress, and I wholeheartedly agree. We'll begin some research to make our choice. Miriam's whole family came by around 1300 with a Birthday card (handmade) and a Happy New Years card, plus an oragami phoenix. Joey isn't doing well and may be put down soon. I got into my second cupa too soon and became quite dizzy and eyes unfocused around noon. Just tapering off now. Guess I'll have to get used to the half-caf stuff from Wegmans. It's really not that bad.
** 17:21 By now the media backup is a little over half done. A pretty quiet day. I'll be fixing Mission BBQ's recipe for black-eyed peas. Apparently eating them on New Years Day brings good luck. We renewed our Lacquie Lawson account and sent cards to family and friends.
** 19:39 Got almost to the end of the media backup and noticed that I had removed the "exclude media/backup" instruction, so I've restarted the whole media backup. It will finish sometime around 0200-0300 tomorrow. No biggie. I'll get that straightened out by next month, I'm sure - just have to get everything used to being 2021. Made the black-eyed peas - they were good but if I do it again I'll leave the cayenne out entirely. Did the dishes, it's raining to beat the band right now. Predicted 54 and sunny tomorrow, then another day of rain on Sunday, high 41.
** 22:27 Had my cereal - play a game and go to bed. When the Media backup finishes, tomorrow, I'll move the camera files from data to media. They're almost completely stable and have been for some time.

** 08:42 For once I slept better than I thought, according to fitbit: 2339-0719, 6:42 89. Foolish dreams about wandering around in large buildings and having luggage stolen at the airport. Won't try to analyze that too deeply. The grow-light burned out this morning, so there's one task for today. I did remember to copy the camera files from data to media - almost all copied over (37GB). Will also copy media/backups to backup/tarfiles.

** 14:56 Went to Home Depot and got a LED grow light. Returned the Rosseti book on Time on the way. Helped Valerie clean front door and kitchen door windows.
** 16:31 Just finished a shower. Valerie has sliced the big sweet potato on the mandolin and baked it as chips. She's talking to Ans now.

** 08:40 Been copying the media tar to OFFSITE2 overnight, seems to be stalled with 100GB still to go. Wonder whether it's a flaw in the file manager app (Thunar?). The "File Operation Progress" process says 262.3GB has been copied. I'm tempted to kill the copy and restart it using only the terminal. Judging from the activity light on the remote drive, very little is happening.
** 08:54 Decided to use rsync from a bash buffer in this emacs window. Using -ah --progress flags it says that it'll take 3-6 hours. Transfer rate fluctuates between 14-32MB/s. 
** 08:58 Another night where I seem to have slept better than it seemed: 2350-0739, 7:00 88. Lots of rain overnight, just a little now.
** 11:28 Transfer is at 46% now, still fluctuating between 15-33MB/s, 1.5-3 hours remaining.
** 12:53 Transfer is at 64% now, and rate is fluctuating between 400kB/s-12MB/s. Perhaps the right way to keep the media drive, which changes much less frequently, properly backed up is to tar each top-level directory and keep the latest on the OFFSITE drives.

** 13:02 That's what I'll do. Creating a new tar for pictures, copying both Thunderbird archives, music for starters.
** 15:27 Just back from a short, wet walk with Valerie. greatcourses tar almost finished copying to OFFSITE2, seems that there isn't a copy of the new data tar, so that has to be done, and the new pictures tar, and then that will finally be done.
** 21:01 The final tar file, the pictures, is on its way. We did the Dutch sausage, kraut and potatoes with gravy for dinner - it was good. Watched a little TV and just raised the desk about an inch or so and put the right hand arm rest back on the chair. This may not work - the keyboard may be too high. If it isn't, I may remove the plastic drawer that I glued to the underside of the desk - that's the only thing that's rubbing on the arms now.

** 08:44 Both of us suffered from our old mattress last night - it bothered Valerie's sleep a lot, mine a lot less: 2337-0736, 7:19 85.
** 10:38 Removed the little drawer under the desk - it came off quite cleanly and intact - it may be reattached on the left side where it will protrude slightly but not be in the way so much. So far the keyboard is tolerable at the present height, but it might end up being too high and call for dropping the desk an inch or so to still clear the arms. Such a lot of mind-space for such a small thing! Valerie has yoga shortly.
** 15:42 After yoga Valerie was feeling energized, and decided to make scones. I helped a tiny bit and they're all out of the oven and taste magnificent. I found some great quotes, beginning with the ones from the "Large Regular" blog, then moved out to Niels Bohr. One of those was quoted by Heisenberg, so that led me to "Physics and Beyond" which I was surprised and pleased to find that I had a pdf copy of.
** 17:04 Downloaded the newest kindle books to the mac and moved them to Calibre on minos. 
** 22:58 A good meeting - Carl S.'s sponsor. Watched a few videos about language and Gandalf.

** 08:18 Another good night's sleep - 0001-0700, 6:13 85. Overcast, not too cold (37), highs in the low 40s the coming week, lows just under freezing, no precip until next Tuesday. Might see the mud pit in the back yard dry up some. Sounds like Valerie just got up.
** 11:50 Sacha Chua's Emacs News included mu4e-views update, so I updated its configuration which triggered a "not compiled for xwidgets support" - took some looking but found the switches to look for, but finally found the answer and used "./configure --with-mailutils --with-xwidgets --with-imagemagick" and recompiled. Now version 29.1.9 and viewing html mail in mu4e is great! Worth the effort. While it was building I went to Giant and got milk for both of us and a 120-count baby aspirin and took back "Knocking on Heaven't Door" which proved to be pretty much "isn't scientism great!"
** 19:43 We took a long walk after lunch, then Valerie went to Wegman's. I read and dozed until she got home, then we both read and dozed until her phone rang. We finished the potatoes/kraut/sausage dinner tonight with fresh broccoli. Mmmm. Fiddled some with init.el and got ido-mode back the way I'm used to.
** 19:49 Mu4e doesn't seem to be updating - new mail arrives and the counter doesn't increment. When I initiate an update it says that the update is already running. There's always a process running when I stop it. Whether that's part of the new compile, or the mu4e-views package, or the mu4e-views config I don't know yet. I guess the first step will be to comment out the whole mu4e-views config, then if that works, see if I can add elements one at a time to find the one that's breaking it.
** 21:42 With all of mu4e-views commented out, mu4e seems to work. I'm sending one more message to be sure.
** 22:34 And yes, it is definitely working. Now, if I can only get mu4e-views working enough to display html mail as html I'll be pleased. If not, I'd rather have it working as it was before I recompiled and fiddled with it. At least then the messages were all getting into the db. Fading away. Will have a game and maybe a bath, then off to dreamland.

** 08:39 Pretty good sleep: 2357-0810, 7:53 87. Have to rush to get to Michael by 0900.
** 13:13 Walk went pretty well until we reached the tot lot north of 175. Michael wanted to rest, saying that he was nauseous and dizzy. He rested often as we walked back to the SS, and waited for an hour in his car before heading out. I waited with him until 1030. Just now talked with him, he'd just gotten home after having another "swoon" at Costco and rested in his car again. He says that he's about to call his doctor. Hope he does. The nooner was good. I'm expecting to go to Costco shortly for a few things and a chicken, also to Aldi. May try to get to Trader Joe's tomorrow morning for Japanese Rice, might leave Aldi for then.
** 20:54 Costco Gas was too busy, but Costco wasn't and we got Valerie's Rx, a chicken, cereal and pistachios. Aldi was quick, too. An hour's nap, then fixed chicken, baked potatoes and broccoli. A quiet evening since then.
** 23:03 Listening to Uncle Dave's Emacs Tutorial 1 on YouTube. It's a few years old - covers version 25.3 - September, 2017. His videos are a decent length - 10-20 minutes each, instead of an hour each for the System Crafters videos. He has a touch of some Eastern European accent, not a problem, don't know yet whether he's going to be bearable. He talks at a reasonable rate, at least.
** 23:14 Tried to change the CapsLock to Ctrl, using the guide in EmacsWiki - didn't work so far.
** 23:22 Tried using the xkcd keyboard settings tool - didn't seem to work. It turned the caps lock off (maybe a good thing) but didn't make it a ctrl key. However, it did disable the left ctrl. I changed the settings back to "default" and logged out/in again. All's OK now. Probably time to put this and me to bed.

** 08:35 Slept 0033-0731, 6:23 86. However today goes, blaming it on a bad night's sleep won't work. Haven't been entirely successful in ignoring everything that's going on that is out of my control, but I'm somewhat better at just worrying myself sick over it. I can't help feeling that there's some obligation on my part to be involved in our growth or whatever, but it isn't directly involved in what's going down these days. I'm certainly offended and amazed at what's being attempted by the "masters" or "elites" or "experts" - so self-evidently stupid or foolish, but they've sold their souls for the opportunity to do this, which I've not been willing to do. So for now, while I've no doubt been ID'd as a "wrongthinker", I'm almost certainly also not a danger right away. We'll see how things go.
** 17:34 I got the application for Canada Pension completed - Miriam will sign the copies of my citizenship papers tomorrow, and then off in the mail. That's a long-time todo 99% done. Otherwise, not all that much done. Went up Thunder Hill to look at the trash enclosure at the pizza shop and took some pictures.
** 23:30 RAC went smoothly. Wasted the rest of the evening with YouTube.

** 08:31 Asleep at 0026, up at 0704, 6:08 85 - average sleep score the past week is 86. Not sure what that means, I still want a nap some afternoons, but that's what the fitbit says. I guess I don't care enough to put in the time to research how fitbit determines when I'm dreaming, why it seems to think I'm awake a lot more than I do (does it define "awake" differently?). The "digitized self" idea doesn't move me the way it seems to do some folks. OTOH, I do like getting decent sleep.
** 08:36 I did comment of Day by Day now two nights in a row. He called-out "Insty" which I used as a generic for all the somewhat-anti-Deep-State sites/commenters who immediately fell into line, buying the Official Report on what happened at the Capitol the other afternoon. I'm unable to avoid thinking that there's such a thing as "my side" although I do want to not get overly gut-ground about daily events. I do honestly believe that there's a "Narrative" and evil motivation - whether there's a Cabal driving it or not, or whether it's just the natural outcome of the late '60s combination of Fashionable Marxism and Upward Mobility, or whether the Cabal built on the Fashionable Marxism and Upward Mobility, or just what's going on. It does seem like a distraction from getting the War Story and Foreign Country projects happening. Well, I've been seeing Don Surber and David Warren and others saying to avoid responding to current events, depending on who says it the pause in 24 hours, a week or a year, it does seem like a good idea. And maybe distinguish between useful online sources and the online sources' personal opinions. And that's all I have to say about that for now.
** 16:31 Been busy doing this and that. Took Canada Pension app to Miriam to sign. Contacted Novartis and finally got the right info to download the application for their "poor folks" program. Should have both ready by Monday.

** 08:52 Valerie's Birthday! She thinks she slept well, got up not long ago. I slept well, I think, and fitbit agrees: 2336-0802, 7:45 91.
** 10:35 She's happy with her gifts - she always is. Took the lights down from the deck rail and rolled up the power cords. Just the tree to deal with now. Will need to be down in the crawl space to get the tree box. Probably not today, unless that seems like something she wants to do on her birthday. Maybe leave it for tomorrow.
** 17:08 Spent some time catching up with blogs, email back and forth with Harold, took a walk with Valerie. She's on the "phone" with Ans now since 1530. Got the rest of the Christmas lights inside or at least off the deck railing. All three wreaths are inside the green bag. The tree is in the kitchen drying out. Plans for tonight are to get Shrimp Pad Thai for dinner. Vivi texted Valerie a piano concert of "Happy Birthday" and Rob called her. Pretty quiet otherwise. A card did arrive from Nancy.
** 17:43 Installed Brave, 1Password, uBlock Origin, Library Extension, set as default, transferred the bookmarks, saved the whole set of bookmarks and began thinning them out - did camera heading and some of church. 
** 18:52 Probably about time to order food.
** 22:43 We paid for shrimp and got chicken, so we're down a few dollars and I don't feel like going back for a refund. Tough. Really sleepy.

** 09:18 And a good night's sleep - woke up a bit confused - misread the clock as 0902 instead of 0802. Still, good numbers: 2358-0802, 7:25 86. Didn't get out of bed once overnight. Went to sleep reading Saving the Appearances, chapter XXII and finding a fair number of little typos. I must check the git update to see where the last edits were, and carry on cleaning up the text.
** 13:11 Just bought a new mattress - by the same maker as the one that Miriam has, and an upgrade that she would like to buy. And she's always right, right? It's a hybrid - has coils and a foam top. No word on its arrival date, hopefull by the time that the county will remove the old one on its normal "big load" schedule (end of the month?). There is a free "try it" period. Valerie also wants to get linen sheets. When she does in the next day or two we'll bundle them into an AmEx plan and pay no interest for a year.
** 16:24 Tried hard to get a good alternative to FireFox - installed Brave and got it all set up but then found that there was no way to forbid 3rd-party cookied from everyone *except* Instapaper. Finally gave up and installed Chrome, which I know does, but after a lot of setup, found that it's the source of Brave's change from before. So both of them are uninstalled and I'm back to Firefox. For now I'll just have to hold my nose and use Mozilla's tool.

** 12:22 Managed to shower and start the bread before 10. Actually getting connected to the tele-health link was impossible. Fortunately, Maria called and we talked. Bread has just been punched-down and is rising for the second time. Valerie has gone to Dr. Lazris' office to leave a urine sample.
** 12:53 Updated theme, org-journal and dash (again?). Not sure that everything is working properly, suspicious since "autoremove" keeps wanting to remove packages that are just reinstalled next time I start. T'ain't right.
** 14:09 Bread is almost raised in the pans - giving it another 10. Valerie is talking with Susan so I'll give her as much privacy as I can. Chicken bones are boiling for soup. It's been a busy day so far.
** 21:52 Good meeting - "Programming Historian" just published an article about command-line OCR conversion of a PDF to text. Uses ImageMagick to convert PDF to TIFF, then Tesseract to OCR. I installed Tesseract including hebrew and greek language packs.

Birds are fed, I'm dressed and evacuated my bowels, so all's right with the world. It's cold and sunny, predicted to be moderate - 46F. District meeting tonight instead of OMCA Board meeting, only the second one I'll have missed in the past year. Checking in with Ben at 11.
** 13:44 Seems that our Cisco stock was transferred to the State of MD some time ago. I'm sure that it was totally legal. Working on the Vestry minutes now.

** 16:51 Walk went well, I came home quite "serene" and didn't do much before the nooner. There, I came too close to being a Bleeding Deacon, fortunately I did apologize to some of them afterward. Will have to remember to do the same to the rest of the gang next Wednesday. Went to Costco for gas and Aldi for this and that. Valerie got the chili almost done - I did the last little bit while she lay down. Time to get her up now.

** 11:32 Dove right in to copying all of the posts from the consultingsmiths.com blog in preparation for deleting the WP presence at that address. As of now, the database seems to have been deleted (I should check that it's actually not there rather than just given some "not there" value with the data still in place). Should also have them delete the backups if I can. As of a few minutes ago the WP application files are in place, but my new index.html file is what appears if I go to that address. So, if the php filed don't disappear, I can always delete them myself. I did put a ticket in asking how best to delete the WP files, and also whether to use that folder or the ~/public_html/consultingsmiths folder. I'm sure to hear from them in a day or so. Planning to install Valerie's bidet this afternoon.
** 12:50 Heard from Namecheap support and everything is done. There's a basic index.html in place - .htaccess files will need editing - and that's good for now. Next step will be to get a workflow with Emacs and hugo or something like that in place, and git of course. I've gotten a good start on Valerie's plumbing project. Next is to drill the hole in the vanity to let the hot water supply get to the bidet. There's some anxiety about choosing the right place, but it can't be too awfully wrong wherever I do it if I'm not terribly stupid about it.
** 14:20 Had some of Valerie's left over pad thai, then went for a walk with Valerie. Just arranged with AmEx to pay for the mattress over a year with no interest or fee.
** 16:02 Bidet is installed, seems to work and so far no leaks.

** 09:30 Stayed up late, 0109-0829, 6:43 89 so I seem to have slept OK anyway. Had a very hot bath before getting into bed. Plan is to get down into the crawl space, retrieve the Christmas tree box, and get all the decorations back under the floor today. Valerie has a noon meeting and a 1400 appointment.
** 12:44 Got the box up from the crawl space and took the box of blankets down. Vacuumed the back end of the house pretty well. Valerie is on the Al-Anon nooner now. I've spent some time looking for a way to have org-mode use typographic quotes. It might work for exports. At any rate, I'd like to do some basic trials getting org-mode and hugo working to replace the consultingsmiths.com blog. Keeping the blog going isn't really that critical - I have no evidence that anyone looks at it other than Google, but I'd like to know how to have a workflow that goes from Emacs and git at the desktop to a working, growing static web site somewhere on the internet. 
** 12:49 Emacs is updated with new markdown, theme, dash and ht.
** 13:07 Added org-mode to typopunct and typographic quotes and dashes work for org documents, too. “See, it’s working—just like in markdown—which is just what I wanted all along”!
** 15:50 Spent some time vacuuming, then took the garland down and put the batteries in the charger. Packed the tree into the box and took a short walk. Valerie got home just before I did—says that she’s feeling better but a little dopey. At any rate we both got things done today around the house. We can now move over to the stuff we want for our own little priorities.
** 21:39 I got go and hugo installed, and got too far ahead of myself following a tutorial and started the blog over again. It’s (consultingsmiths) basically working, and now I have to read the docs and get my head around how it works, and how to make it behave the way I want it to. Then I reorganized the Instapaper store to have a Hugo folder and a config just under Emacs. Enough Emacs fiddling for tonight, I think. Maybe look into Hugo again some tomorrow.
** 21:57 This will take some getting used to. I ran across an old steveyegge article about being effective with Emacs, and it had the code to swap left ctrl and caps lock, so I put it into .profile and etc. and now it works! Very cool. Except I’ve been using left ctrl for 30/40 years and it’s going to take some getting used to using the caps lock location. Oh, well, I’ll just have to work at it. And if I don’t like it 2-3 weeks from now I can make it go away.

** 09:17 So far, I’ve remembered to use caps lock as left ctrl - I know that I’ll goof some today. Slept well again, 2358-0751, 7:12 88. Will try to get a better understanding of Hugo and ox-hugo today. It may or may not be worth figuring out how to structure daslearns.ca with Hugo to be a fieldstones repository (single file, combining all the various years, maybe not correcting chronological order for the older ones?), notes for various key books (History in English Words, Poetic Diction, Saving the Appearances, The Shining Stranger, The Order of Time, Reality is Not What it Seems, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, The Idea of the World, etc.). Since a Hugo repository for all of those would be on my data drive, would I benefit from actually pushing it to namecheap? Is there a local search tool that I could use that would do what Google’s Advanced search page does?
** 10:00 I managed to get my 250 steps in for the first hour today. My Google/Fitbit overlords are not going to be disappointed with me today!
** 11:50 Did dishes, have walked 250 steps three hours in a row. Whoopee! Bird seed is outside.
** 13:57 Steps now 5 hours out of 5. About to walk with Valerie.
** 16:24 Now it’s 8 of 12 done - it’s a silly game but I’m playing it, at least today. Went to both Giants looking for V’s Tofutti, got onions, sour cream, bananas and milk. Helped with the soup a little and now am going to lie down for a few. Lower back is hurting.
** 18:08 Awoke in time to squeeze 250 steps in before the hour - I believe I had taken 8 at ten to. It did get my heart started again having so little time, but it seems to have worked out. So that’s 9 of 12 hours today, fwiw. V has made soup, right now she’s knitting and watching something on TV. Perhaps time to look at Hugo docs and begin to get my head around it.
** 18:46 Installing fslint and recoll. The first to locate, mainly, copies of document files that are in Calibre and also other places, mainly in the data/WWW folders. Recoll is a search engine for text that comes highly recommended. Uses xapian for the index, like mu does. We’ll see how that goes.
** 19:59 FSLint seems to blow the xmodemap rewrite right off, and does some other odd things to the keyboard. “source .profile” after exiting fslint seems to put it all right again. Checking the whole data drive uncovers a whole lot of extranious hits - like emails. Better to choose particular folders.
** 20:55 Removed all duplicates from Calibre.
** 23:02 Still having trouble with the new ctrl. Fiddled with fslint probably too long today, but there you go. enough. play a game, eat some cereal and go to bed.

** 14:23 Miriam and the girls came by around 1000 - a birthday card and origami peacock for Valerie. FedEx stopped while they were here and we thought that it was our mattress a day early. A bit later they (FedEx) came by again and it was the mattress. They brought it up to the kitchen door. I dragged it into the bedroom, got the old mattress off the bed, and followed their instructions for getting it out of the box and in place. Took maybe a half hour. Looks promising - it’s comfortable now, should be better tonight, and they predict will be even better after 24 hours. Valerie is off looking for a new mattress cover. Ours is 7 years old, and some expert says to replace them every two years. Not sure why, but then I’m not an expert! Woke up with low back pain, there’s a little bit still, but it’s much better. Did the dishes and boiled more eggs.
** 14:36 Might need to pull my stuff from GitHub - I wonder whether GitLab is any better? Or do I really need either?
** 19:00 We’ve had dinner, the sheets are washed and the bed is made with the new mattress cover and clean sheets.
** 21:19 I discovered a folder under WWW named “Blogs” and inside it, a pdf with 2010-2011 consultingsmith blog content. I tried out the OCR trick with ImageMagick to change the pdf to tiff, then tesseract to do OCR on the tiff. I then had to go through and clean up line breaks and the like, but the OCR seemed perfect. A good technique, and now I have all of those pithy sayings in markdown format.
** 21:57 So now I’m on gab as @thewordsmith - I followed Harold and he followed me.
** 22:50 And it’s almost 11 and I’m shutting this down. Bought linen sheets for the new mattress-Valerie will be pleased. Tonight we try the new mattress, new cover and old sheets out. I have high hopes.

** 08:40 0005-0744, 6:51 86. Had hoped that a new mattress would ease the pain in my left hip while sleeping on my left side, but no luck. Nevertheless, it is comfortable. Looking at the forecast the coming week will be pretty uneventful - mid-40s and nights just below freezing. Some snow showers next week.
** 12:25 I’ve relocated a lot of text files after noticing how little I use the data/writing folder and how disbursed a lot of files are. I’m not at all near being done, but it’s a start. Probably time to do an interim backup of data, by the way. Showered, staying up on my 250 steps so far. And upon looking, there’s no snar file for the latest data tar, so that won’t happen this month.
** 21:31 FWIW, I got the 250 steps in all 12 hours today. Got a good start on having the website hosted with Hugo. Ran into some tutorials that seemed to be useful which ended up not being so good. My old friend Flavio came through, though. Just have to choose the template and figure how to get Hugo to post updates to namecheap. Shouldn’t be too terribly arcane. Still botching the ctrl key, but maybe a little less often, or catching it faster.
** 23:06 Looks like ssh and rsync is the way to get the files to namecheap, although maybe git can do it. Anyway, we’re both going to hit the hay early tonight. Bye.

** 08:27 Fitbit’s notion of my sleep last night is quite weird. 2357-0121, then 0257-0746, 5:38 74. I really don’t remember being “awake” for an hour and a half in the middle of the night in any meaningful sense of “awake”. Also, now that I look at the app on the phone, it’s telling me that my “hourly activity” aka hourly steps were met one time yesterday. Of course, although my impression is that it was telling me “good goin’, kid” last night for hitting all 12 hours, now the phone app is saying 1 of 12 hours. It’s really hard to take it very seriously. The unit’s charge is 79%, so low power isn’t likely to be the issue. Aaaand, a phone reboot and now it’s saying 12 of 12 yesterday. Maybe I’ll wear it again today - I do think that it’s a good thing to get up and walk more often then I’m likely to without some sort of program.
** 08:39 It seems like it’s leading me around by the nose - I’m mostly pleased with me when it says I slept well or got lots of exercise, less so when my sleep score is below 80 or I don’t get full credit for my “steps” (even though I realize that they’re not steps at all but arm swings). And now that it all belongs to Google/Alphabet...
** 13:59 Feeling a little better about Hugo according to Flavio’s tutorial. OTOH, I may give some sort of emacs-based solution a try. Still up in the air.
** 17:29 Had a nap, Valerie woke me with a cookie. She lay down herself and I did the dishes while I fried two eggs. Getting ready to head to Crownsville for the Vestry meeting. See you in a few hours.
** 20:38 Back from Vestry, trash is out and recycling emptied. Heated a small bowl of chili.
** 23:09 And that’s it. I’ll be hiking with Michael at 0900 tomorrow, so maybe a good sleep would be a good idea. G’night.

** 10:27 Once again, I slept until 0810 on a Wednesday when I meet Michael at 0900. Slept well - 0006-0809, 7:10 90. Awoke once around 4 or 5 when V had a coughing fit but got back to deep sleep right 
** 10:30 Walked 4.5 miles, talked about Emily Cady’s meditation techniques. Gave him a late copy of Lessons and a print out of chapter 9 from the 1919 edition. Slipped on ice on the hill just past Thunder Hill underpass. Might have wrenched my l knee or hip. Have ice on the knee now. Decided to put off starting bread until after the nooner. It’s sunny and windy today.
** 13:08 Meeting’s over, getting ready to start bread.
** 17:31 Bread has been rising in the pans for 50 minutes. Giving them another ten and then we start the bake. Valerie is going to roast a chicken breast when I’m done.
** 20:48 The chicken was great. I went to LAMart for vegetables and chose a squash. At checkout all I had was my wallet and no cash, and with a bill of $0.50 they wouldn’t take a card. The nice man behind me paid for the squash, so now I must pay it forward the first chance I get. Or is that good karma for taking a bag of canned goods and pasta to the CCC give-away this evening? I’ll never know. I think I’ve found enough information to start trying the org-static-blog package. It looks like it might do the trick for me.

** 09:35 Had a good sleep: 2356-0744, 7:01 83. Spent my first waking time with Cady’s Chapter 9. Are there some typos in the mobi version? Some good posts at different blogs: Hoyt linked to “serpents house” on disconnection, and Yarvin on “The Cathedral” and not “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” rather journalism and academia. Both seem good at least first thing. 
** 10:10 A Cardinal was looking very upset that the seed wasn’t available, so I took it out and fixed raisin toast for V and I. Got my steps in for the first hour of the day.
** 11:27 Bed is made with the new linen sheets. The Canada Pension application is ready to mail. Valerie will take to the PO on her way to Wegman’s later today.
** 12:13 I’m printing the Org Manual bit by bit. It’s pretty clear that I’m going to have to become more conversant with org-mode, at least the terminology, if I’m to make it a usable blogging platform. Which seems worthwhile. In addition to the manual, I’ll follow the tutorials that are recommended (or so I say today).
** 13:20 Back from a good walk with Valerie. Everything I bumped yesterday feels fine today - thank God!
** 20:34 Finished the RAC in less than an hour. Also managed to get 250 steps all 12 hours today. We had the other chicken breast with microwaved rice (it went well this time...used a full recipe) and wilted spinach.
** 21:48 Beginning to get the blog working with org-static-blog. The pages are clunky (no css yet) but they are getting created and I’m finding them where I expect to find them.
** 22:24 Plenty of odd little things happen - text gets thrown in at the bottom of the page (the postamble) that isn’t in the postamble file, but I’ll get it figured out and working. It’s basically there. Just using Bastian Bechtold’s css for now. It isn’t horrid. I do want the text to be what I want, though.
** 22:39 Among the things that aren’t working right just now is external links moving from org to html. They aren’t being converted at all so far. Also when creating a new file, it has to be published twice - the first time it says “trying to something a deleted buffer.” Oh, well, I’m getting close, and now I have a printed Org manual so I can get up to speed on export and etc.

** 07:51 0011-0645, 6:45 88. Misread the clock when I got up to pee, thought it was 0535. Went back to bed but Valerie was already up and I didn’t feel sleepy so I got up, too. She’s worried about her abdominal pain now. Dreamt about how to have more than one blog. As in one using org-static-blog - the real “blog”, and another that uses pure org export. I guess that was the point of printing the org manual - so I can get a handle on how org works that way.
** 07:56 Another “nice” day, broken clouds from the west, 25F, forecast 46. Rain expected Monday afternoon through to Tuesday morning. Colder days for the next ten days or so - 40 or less, nights mid to low 20s. It is January, after all!
** 13:20 Valerie has been to the urologist’s office and has been in bed for several hours. Will get her up for her 1530 call with Ans. I’m feeling a little wonky - headache and stomach unease. May be just from wearing the “computer” glasses. I think I need to give it a rest for now. I tried converting md files to org with pandoc, but after too long noticed that it didn’t honor word wraps. It’s like converting from a pdf where every logical paragraph is six short sentences. Bah!
** 15:22 Had sort of a nap, got up at ten to and got in my 250 steps, and just now discovered how to make pandoc *not* wrap lines - “–wrap=none” is the trick. So, I’ll go back and try again.
** 16:28 data/md is no more. look for those folders in data/org and edit the org versions. Also moved org-roam into org. There’s a good chance that I’ll rework those files into another text “brain” and remove org-roam entirely. Lots of people seem to like it a lot, I don’t so far.
** 23:26 And this is today. We had salmon, rice, broccoli and salad, watched some Curators’ Corner on YouTube, and now I’m going to bed.

** 09:15 Seems like I slept well - woke for the first time around 0730, got up at 0829. 2349-0829, 8:05 85. It must be the new mattress and linen sheets. Overcast and windy, around 29 when I got up. We’ll take canned goods to the Other Barn sometime this morning.
** 11:23 We made the trip to the Other Barn and talked with Sandy a bit. Still quite windy. Must remember to connect with Adriana at noon.
** 11:47 TurboTax won’t install on my MacBook now - MacOS is too old - so the day will come when it makes sense to install some other OS on it. For now it’s worthwhile to keep it for Microsoft Office, but probably not forever. It might be worth looking into having dual boot to keep Kindle/Calibre and iCloud working for the iPad...just thought of all that. It never gets too uncomplicated, does it? At any rate, I’ll get a deal on TurboTax for Windows via AmEx, so I can’t buy it from Costco. Right now I’m booting Windows on the second box to get it updated and maybe do some tightening up on how it works. Just got a text from Adriana that she needs to be with her Mom today - we’ll talk tomorrow.
** 12:55 Valerie is taking give-aways to a church that collects them. Windows is updated and Brave is installed with 1Password. It’s somewhat early to get TurboTax - I can wait until Tax Day to get the $5 AmEx discount, and I can’t go too far without some of the documents from Ben’s and others. Or maybe there’s the $15 discount from Intuit that expires today - so I’ll restart and buy it now. Glad I caught that.
** 13:11 It’s installed and downloading updates.
** 15:28 It’s been updated, started, activated, connected to last year’s data, and all shut down some time. I have bread pudding in the oven.
** 18:20 Got the linksys router working - it took me longer than it should - I ended up resetting it and building it up using the phone app. Seems to be faster than the netgear, which it should be, since it’s so much newer. Pudding looks good. Leftovers for dinner.
** 23:03 G’night.

** 09:21 Slept well, which is becoming the norm: 2356-0830, 8:01 87. A little stiff but not too bad. Reread Sarah’s blog post from yesterday (she linked it from her stint on Insty overnight). It’s a good one - what to do in the mean time. Reminds me of Voltaire’s Bastards - I’ll get that down and look it over again. I remember that it made a really powerful impression on me when I read it what, 25 years ago?
** 10:17 It’s Cindy’s and Jim’s birthdays today, so I managed to get Jacquie Lawson cards to them before the last minute. Good on me!
** 11:58 Boiled 7 eggs and am ready to connect with Adriana at noon.
** 14:44 Talked with Adriana until 1345 or so. Valerie joined us pretty early on. Learned that Cait is having trouble in Edmonton, but is getting help. Adriana is still in pain from the thumb injury, but seems to be in good spirits overall. Jen and Joc seem to be doing well. Josie isn’t. She has some sort of issue with her bile duct and other related organs, has had several surgeries and now is in almost constant pain, isn’t eating or shitting. It doesn’t look good for her. I just finished hanging up Valerie’s ironing board hanger, so that’s another thing done. Baby steps.

** 09:45 According to fitbit, I was awake until almost 0200, and I don’t begin to believe it. 0153-0905, 6:43 88. I did stay awake longer than usual after a bath, and got an idea for an intro to Foreign that had me relating to Toruk, Son of Stone and Tom Corbet, Space Cadet as if we all had the same consciousness, and maybe the thing to do would be to try to tell whether a kid of the mid-1940s could be conscious the same way as they were or they will be. While I did have heroes from the present (or recent past - “army men” and “navy log” sailors) most of my imagination was the past, or some the future. Cowboys, Knights in Shining Armor, Robin Hood, the like.
** 12:09 I’ve gotten fed up with C-x f showing me a list of files that were part of an elpa installation or files I’ve opened last week but not the file I opened ten minutes ago. The first site I opened after searching “emacs recent configuration” was by patrickt at github, and covered his entire setup. I’m going to come back to this later, but I went down the rabbit hole and changed a bunch of things as well as eliminating recent listing files in the elpa folder. Or, I hope it’s eliminated them. Been sitting since forever, so I’d better get up, walk around some and eat something.
** 13:14 Got up, walked around some, did the dishes, fried some bacon before I realized that I’m out of eggs, so set it aside for this evening’s rice and beans. Put the soup away.
** 13:38 Just sent an email to Joe N. to ask if he can suggest someone to be our traditions speaker on February 8
** 13:42 One of the changes that I made to init.el is to turn row numbers on globally. Maybe I’ll love it, maybe not. We’ll see.
** 14:09 Going to shut down and try the new KVM switch. Here’s to you, kid!
** 15:01 It’s a VM switch for at least minos - the PS2 keyboard seems to be necessary. At least restarting minos still goes OK. I’ll start kootenay now and see whether the video and mouse switch properly. If it’s possible to use the one mouse it may be a plus even if the two keyboards are still necessary.
** 15:16 The mouse and video works but for some reason the hard-wired keyboard is dead. We’ll have to try again...oops, when I switched back, the video is the same on both monitors. That’s not good. I was able to reset everything with the xfce settings app. This would be tolerable if I don’t get in the habit of switching back and forth all that often. I wonder if I can find a ps2 keyboard switch?
** 15:21 And it turns out that I’d plugged kootenay’s keyboard into the PS2 mouse socket. That’s a pretty clear diagnosis and should fix things now.
** 15:33 And even when it’s plugged in correctly, it doesn’t work somehow. I wonder whether I could “remote desktop” from minos into kootenay, at least to do our taxes. Otherwise it sounds like the 22” monitor will be kootenay’s and the 24” minos’ and I’ll just get used to that. It’s never easy, is it?
** 16:23 It might be the best thing to get an hdmi switch for the 22” monitor (after verifying that I’m using the hdmi line) and return the kvm switch, learn to live with two mice and keyboards, and use the 22” monitor for alternately kootenay and a minos second.
** 16:48 And that’s how it will be. The 22” will connect to minos via hdmi and kootenay via vga and I can switch source at the monitor. Both boxes will have their own keyboards and mice, which I’ve lived with so far, and that’ll be that. It’ll mean shutting minos down one more time to rearrange the vga lines and the mouse, but I can live with that.
** 17:39 Monitor works fine - keyboard doesn’t work at all. I have three PS-2 keyboards in addition to the one on minos - none of them seem to work, although num-lok lights. I may have blown the PS-2 port, I guess, and if so, perhaps a usb keyboard with be the solution.
** 22:59 It took a while, but I plugged in the Microsoft PS-2 keyboard and booted kootenay to the Ubuntu 18.04 live CD. The keyboard worked just fine. I then rebooted to Windows and logged in using the on-screen keyboard. I activated the on-screen keyboard again, and tried some of the troubleshooting tools, to no avail. So I deleted the keyboard in the device manager and rebooted. Everything works as expected. It’s easy to shift the right monitor from HDMI to VGA, so I have the fully active Debian browser, file manager and terminal on one hand, and the Win box on the other. I think we’re OK. I should be able to sleep well, or at least not worry about this item. Amazon will take back the KVM.

** And I did sleep well - 09:13 0033-0812, 7:02 88. Got a fair bit of snow last evening before it turned to rain. Now it looks like a layer of crunch atop a bit of snow. Some ice on the driveway, road looks clear. Deck may be pretty slippery. We shall see.
** 09:27 Working through the morning links...some good quotes from A Large Regular.
** 09:49 Stuck a few of those quotes on the fieldstones page, another, somewhat political, on the dummy consultingsmiths.com blog index page. Who knows what will come of that.
** 10:23 We planned to pick up two used bar stools at a church rummage store, but they’re closed. I just took the bird seed out, shoveled the deck and dragged the old mattress out to the car port. It’s nice to have it out of the hall! We’re moving right along!
** 13:16 I dropped the KVM off at UPS, bought milk, eggs and dishwasher detergent at Giant, dropped Valerie’s book at the library and picked mine up, remembered that I went to Giant mainly to get two sympathy cards, went back and bought them. Oh, well, all’s good in the end. Roads were totally safe, some scotch mist.
** 13:18 Still somewhat slow getting the right key to use at ctrl...might need to switch it back to the normal setting, particularly since kootenay (at least under Win10) will be “normal”.
** 13:50 Grackles have taken over our bird feeders the past few days - we’re going to give them a few days off and keep the seed inside. Maybe they’ll find somewhere else to go.
** 13:52 Ctrl is back in it’s normal place - not sure that caps lock is anywhere. Now I may have trained my fingers to use the new layout so well that it’ll take time to get back to the old way.
** 14:19 Got a call from Jesse - he’s taking another course, Intro to Algebra - and I need to send him $$. He’ll email me the right PayPal account to credit with $920. And yes, now ctrl is confusing me because I’m not sure which ctrl to use...wouldn’t you know!

** 08:45 And the mattress is gone without a trace, I’m dressed and will head out to meet Michael in a few minutes.
** 10:54 Had a long walk with Michael - 4.5 miles. The girls came by shortly after I got back at 1025. I suggested that Michael contact his minister and ask about activities that would get him involved with the congregation like Bible study or the like.
** 13:12 Finished meeting at 1255 and managed to get the 250 steps in anyway. Then put laundry in the dryer and was credited with 93 steps standing there...
** 18:06 Had a lie-down for almost an hour while Valerie spoke with Ans. Got up in time to walk my 250 steps. Time to start supper.
** 20:41 Enough rice & beans left for yet another dinner. Chose a few more Kindle Unlimited books since the free account ends on February 8th.
** 21:28 Fiddling with recent to get the list more reasonable - cut out files that I haven’t opened on over a week and include files that I opened earlier today! Deleted the “recent” file and starting over. It seems to fill with ~/.emacs.d/bookmarks right off the bat, although I’m not sure that I’ve ever opened it other than once earlier today just to see what the hell it was that recent thought was so important. So far it seems to be helping.
** 21:58 Rearranged some Instapaper layout with a new EmacsPackages folder and exported links.

** 08:53 Slept from 0000 to 0630 according to me. Plugged the fitbit into the charger around 2200 last night and forgot to put it back on. So there! When I woke up I thought that I’d just stay up and attend the 3rd Step meeting at 0730, which I did. Good to see everyone - Ray, Joe, Dan, Kristy, not sure how many more were from 2013 before we moved away. 
** 16:27 Around 1030 we went to Elkridge to pick-up two bar stools from the church thrift store. While there I saw that there was a Nook Color in good physical shape for $8 and snapped it up. Bought gas on the way home. I’ve been fiddling with it most of the rest of the day. It doesn’t want to connect to WiFi, or rather, the WiFi app appears to connect - it’s logged into artemis-24 and received an address, but the Nook OS insists that it’s not connected. It also doesn’t appear as a file system on minos or the Mac. I did manage to get it to factory reset and it now recognizes the sd card with all of the Calibre collection of epubs. That’s a start. It may need a new battery, and it may benefit from being rooted and rebuilt as plain android. All I really want is another epub reader, and I’d really prefer that it had a slicker way to add a file (slicker than removing the sd card, copying it, and reinstalling). At any rate, so far it’s taken $8 and 5 hours of my life. Not bad if it actually works.
** 20:04 My epubs are actually on the sd card and available to the reader. That’s good. The battery is very slow to charge. I’ve turned the wifi off, so that may help it discharge slower. We’ll see how that goes. We watched some “Who do you think you are” with Patrick Stewart and J.K. Rowling, then some Graham Norton and Valerie is watching Bernadette recut an overcoat now.

** 14:00 Valerie’s been asleep for several hours. My hair is dry enough now to go outside, and I’m getting ready to go buy some safflower seed for the birds. Apparently crows, grackles, starlings all don’t like the bitter taste, while cardinals, and most songbirds love it. We’ll see.
