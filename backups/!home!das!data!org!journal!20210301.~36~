** 10:24 Sitting on hold to get the delivery of Entresto arranged. 25 minutes or so and counting. At least the music is classical piano - Mozart, maybe Back, like that.
** 12:00 I’ve talked with one person, am now waiting to talk with the pharmacy. 
** 14:06 Still waiting - I’ve put the phone back on the charger - being on hold for 4 hours ate 45% of its power.
** 17:06 They came on line and took my phone number. Called back around 1615 - meds will be here Wednesday.

** 22:45 Ate Chinese, watched some more Harry Potter shorts, then the first Magritte episode. Heavy, but very well done. Will want to look for Poirot - the ABC Murders with John Malkevich on Amazon Prime.

** 08:28 Ben’s assessment is that the only solution is to remove it/her, and so the next step is to submit an application to the RAC. I’ll get that in today. His bill is $450, which is great. Much better than hauling berries all Fall.
** 10:20 Armando will do the yard for $475. Turns out that they do trees, too. Since the ginkgo is the last large tree that we’re likely to take, we’re not likely to get him to do that but we can recommend him. Must get the application in today.
** 12:32 Just sent the application off - bread is in the oven for the second proving. Half-hour to go.
** 15:55 Bread looks good. Walked to Parallel to look at the application there - they’d already done the work, so pfffft. Aiming for a nap now.
** 22:35 Woke with a bad headache. Mike was away so I led the RAC meeting - it went OK. Just got word that Mike’s dad passed last night.

** 11:36 Met John outside - Brenda has had knee replacement, he has bad arthritis.
** 13:44 Playing with fonts in Modus Themes. Variable width DejaVu works ok but still working on sizes. (+ 70 70) is a bit too big for my taste (and monitors).
** 14:05 Gave up and back to original (before today’s fiddling) settings. Would like to be able to toggle variable-width for buffer contents the way I can toggle dark or light theme. Will have to learn more about Modus themes, I guess.

Valerie isn’t happy with the new mattress - I looked-up the purchase info and their phone number, it’s on her plate to call them and find out whether they have an option that’d be better for her. I must admit that my hip was a little sore this morning around 0500, and has been other nights. Just read a Vox post that Milo has come-out as straight. Or at least ex-gay. Interesting. He quoted (or paraphrased) Walker Percy as saying that modern man has two choices, Rome or California. Even more interesting.

Was vacuuming when Jesse called and we talked for an hour. Work is OK, lots of covid cases still. School, algebra esp., is still hard. He’s going to buy a “studio shed” for the back yard to act as his office so that Graham can sleep in his old office. That will make it possible to stay in their present house for a few more years. I offered to lend him $5K for a few weeks if that’s what it takes to take advantage of a sale price.

** 16:40 Good meeting, Nigel shared a link to a meeting that he would lead at 1900 Zulu. I reread and improved the draft minutes and sent it to Cathy. Miriam shared that Vivian’s piano recital would be at 1300. I mostly built the Ikea cabinet for the LR. We watched Vivian play, I attended Nigel’s meeting (they all seem to be 90 minutes in GB) and Cathy returned the Draft. I updated it per her requests and sent it to the Vestry. This was almost 1600 when Valerie remembered that she was overdue to call Ans. They just now got off their call. We may go for a walk now.

** 13:06 Realized that my last eye exam was July 2019, and I’m due for another one. The last one didn’t change my 2015 Rx for the right eye other than the axis, but the left also changed the sphere, so there might be a significant difference. I used the Johns Hopkins online mychart site to ask for an appointment. Also asked Maria if she could fax the blood work order to Lazris’ office.

** 12:04 Showered, shaved, dressed. Ready for, what? Minutes, probably.
** 15:54 Been fiddling with OpenBSD on kootenay all afternoon, or almost all. I did get a draft Minutes started and ready to listen to the audio file. OpenBSD installed easily and runs fine until I try to get X started, and it just won’d be happy with the DIPLAY variable, or something. I’m about done with it for the moment and think I’ll install FreeBSD for now. If I get an idea I can always reinstall OpenBSD - it takes about 5 minutes max.
** 21:19 Got FreeBSD installed with XFCE with no problem, but it couldn’t recognize my monitor, so it was stuck at 640x480 - not good enough!. So I reinstalled Debian with XFCE and got the monitor up to 1600x1080, which is good on the smaller monitor. Just finished compiling Emacs 28 and shut kootenay down for now. XFCE is configured more or less like it is on minos, so I can configure the two Emacs builds to be subtly different, for example, pushing to different blogs. Will want to have some easy way to swap files between the two - Dropbox perhaps, or whatever.
