** 09:37 It was the code for Nigel’s meeting that was off - he gave the correct one during the speaker meeting that I didn’t attend.
** 10:24 Sitting on hold to get the delivery of Entresto arranged. 25 minutes or so and counting. At least the music is classical piano - Mozart, maybe Back, like that.
** 12:00 I’ve talked with one person, am now waiting to talk with the pharmacy. 
** 14:06 Still waiting - I’ve put the phone back on the charger - being on hold for 4 hours ate 45% of its power.
** 17:06 They came on line and took my phone number. Called back around 1615 - meds will be here Wednesday.

** 17:57 Spent some time organizing more of the War Story letters, added to the outline. Edited another chapter of Poetic Diction. We took a short walk. Plan to go to Mission BBQ or somewhere else and watch a movie tonight.
** 22:45 Ate Chinese, watched some more Harry Potter shorts, then the first Magritte epesode. Heavy, but very well done. Will want to look for Poirot - the ABC Murders with John Malkevich on Amazon Prime.

** 08:48 Good meeting - Alex gave a good lead. Trash is gone, RAC tomorrow, I should check it out today and start the minutes. Also send Adriana her birthday present ($) and arrange a card for Friday. Also ask Jackie about what Finn would like for his birthday.

** 06:57 2351-0551, 5:25 84. Up a little early to meet Ben Wolff between 0700-0730 to look at the gingko biloba out front.
** 08:28 Ben’s assessment is that the only solution is to remove it/her, and so the next step is to submit an application to the RAC. I’ll get that in today. His bill is $450, which is great. Much better than hauling berries all Fall.
** 10:20 Armando will do the yard for $475. Turns out that they do trees, too. Since the gingko is the last large tree that we’re likely to take, we’re not likely to get him to do that but we can recommend him. Must get the application in today.
** 12:32 Just sent the application off - bread is in the oven for the second proving. Half-hour to go.
** 15:55 Bread looks good. Walked to Parallel to look at the application there - they’d already done the work, so pfffft. Aiming for a nap now.
** 22:35 Woke with a bad headache. Mike was away so I led the RAC meeting - it went OK. Just got word that Mike’s dad passed last night.

** 17:31 Did get gift and card to Iana and card to Sarah. Attended Nigel’s meeting at 1500 - which ran for 90 minutes, BTW.
** 19:48 Peacock Channel 7-day free trial - kootenay21 - to watch Harry Potter. $4.99/mo after.

** 12:17 Valerie and I just got back from a trip to Lowes and Aldi. She didn’t find any hangers for the kitchen shelf, so that’s on hold.
** 22:15 We watched the Halfblood Prince after dinner.

** 11:34 Valerie is doing Yoga. Met with Maria - I’ll take BP three or four times a week at various times and report in two weeks. I’ll get an order to do blood work in a month. We’ll meet at her office in three months. Might change dosage before then.
** 11:36 Met John outside - Brenda has had knee replacement, he has bad arthritis.
** 13:44 Playing with fonts in Modus Themes. Variable width DejaVu works ok but still working on sizes. (+ 70 70) is a bit too big for my taste (and monitors).
** 14:05 Gave up and back to original (before today’s fiddling) settings. Would like to be able to toggle variable-width for buffer contents the way I can toggle dark or light theme. Will have to learn more about Modus themes, I guess.
** 21:44 Meeting’s over, a new book on Scheme in Calibre, another book about the election recommended by Small Dead Animals - it was only $3.99.

** 17:02 Bought the hooks at Amazon - they’ll arrive tomorrow. Had a good walk - very nice day. Started reading The Deep Rig. Interesting.
** 17:17 Might consider asking HGA if he’d like a pdf copy.

** 10:24 Another good meeting. Valerie isn’t happy with the new mattress - I looked-up the purchase info and their phone number, it’s on her plate to call them and find out whether they have an option that’d be better for her. I must admit that my hip was a little sore this morning around 0500, and has been other nights. Just read a Vox post that Milo has come-out as straight. Or at least ex-gay. Interesting. He quoted (or paraphrased) Walker Percy as saying that modern man has two choices, Rome or California. Even more interesting.

** 23:40 Did a lot of shopping - returned the coat hooks and got a new lamp plug, got pendaflex and another box, bought ten pairs of underwear (and found that there’s a Warby Parker at the Mall), bought Finn’s birthday gift and card. Also replaced the filter in the HVAC unit.

** 11:13 A good meeting, p 45 “Lack of power, that was our dilemma.” Valerie went to Wegmans, I installed the copper utensils below the spice shelf. Was vacuuming when Jesse called and we talked for an hour. Work is OK, lots of covid cases still. School, algebra esp., is still hard. He’s going to buy a “studio shed” for the back yard to act as his office so that Graham can sleep in his old office. That will make it possible to stay in their present house for a few more years. I offered to lend him $5K for a few weeks if that’s what it takes to take advantage of a sale price.
** 16:39 Got brackets for the curtains for the kitchen door and they’re installed. Good to have that out of the way.
** 22:11 Finally finished the Vestry minutes. Give them a scan in the morning and send them to Cathy.

** 16:40 Good meeting, Nigel shared a link to a meeting that he would lead at 1900 Zulu. I reread and improved the draft minutes and sent it to Cathy. Miriam shared that Vivian’s piano recital would be at 1300. I mostly built the Ikea cabinet for the LR. We watched Vivian play, I attended Nigel’s meeting (they all seem to be 90 minutes in GB) and Cathy returned the Draft. I updated it per her requests and sent it to the Vestry. This was almost 1600 when Valerie remembered that she was overdue to call Ans. They just now got off their call. We may go for a walk now.
** 22:52 Clocks changed, ready to lay down now. Going to church tomorrow morning.

** 09:39 Good meeting if sparsely attended. Showered and dressed, ready to leave for church at 1020 - Valerie decided to come a few minutes ago. She wasn’t going to earlier because she is aching.
** 20:00 Reading went well, it was nice to be in Church although Fr. Thomas’ sermon went on too long. We both crashed when we got home, slept two hours and two minutes according to fitbit.
** 21:18 Had a nice supper - salmon salad on toast, green salad, wilted spinach. Nice easy dinner.

Cloudy, 40F, some precip overnight (it was spitting/Scotch mist when I drove home from Vestry). Herrera says he’ll come this morning. Probably good to devote some time to taxes and/or the review of our estate planning.
** 09:32 Herrera is finished - back yard filled with 2 yds topsoil, pre-emergent and bug juice then seeded, rest of the yard just pre-emergent and bug juice.
** 10:47 Ran emacs updates, updated themes, dash and elfeed, deleted olivetti. Boiled eggs.
** 13:32 Both fountain pens are working now. The cartridge wasn’t fully punctured before.
** 14:20 Windows is updated, Valerie is taking food and diapers to the community cares site. I’m going to try to get some taxes done.
** 19:07 Just finished the taxes - Federal is filed, Maryland copied to pdf.

Guess we’ll know eventually. Today is Finn’s 14th birthday and we’re going to visit him early afternoon. RAC tonight.
** 22:30 The drive to Jesse’s was easy, the visit was nice, we got home OK. The RAC was fairly easy - the first app was a problem, took almost an hour before we tabled it.
