* Meeting at the Grant Hotel

The KatyB departed Espiritu Santo on March 26, 1944 bound for San Diego carrying 44 dud aircraft. On April 3 she crossed the Equator again, and this time the appropriate ceremonies were held for all the pollywogs on board. She arrived (San Diego) April 10, and was ready to head out again three days later, carrying 82 aircraft and 457 passengers, bound for Pearl and the Marshall Islands.

She arrived Pearl on April 20, debarked passengers, and left immediately for Majuro Atoll, arriving April 27 after an uneventful voyage escorted by USS Chandler (DD-206). Aircraft were unloaded and she debarked for Pearl April 29, arriving May 4 and arrived San Diego May 13th with serious engine trouble.



** Letter Majuro Atoll H to M April 28, 1944

Apr 28

Darling,

Since you probably got my letters written en-route you know we arrived ok. Not much here and surely must be a good reason why it's worth fighting for. I will say it's busy for its size though.

We are scheduled for swimming this afternoon and I'll be there even if I burn up in the process. With all the tan I have I still burned my forehead, nose, neck and forearms yesterday noon while we entered the harbor. Sun must have really been hot.

Darling, I'm going to chance a prophecy that we will be together in two weeks so if you feel lucky you can arrange to hit Diego around the 13-15th of May. We may not go to Diego but if we don't it will be close (if we go back to States at all). They can't put off our availability much longer.

When you get there get in touch with the wives so they can reach you if they get any news. We can still use the Grant as a trading post. I promise I won't stop you this time even if we don't click on the time right away.

So far all availabilities have been at San Pedro, Mare Island (Frisco) or San Diego -- none at Pearl -- so if we are due for one, and we are by far the longest overdue of all, we will get to the States this trip. If you have your ticket and the return date doesn't suit you, have it re-dated. We are sure now we're going half-way back at least and not farther out.

More later

Impatiently -- Smitty

Just to be sure, he daubed a bit of his aftershave --- Mennen's Skin Bracer --- on the envelope and added a note "smell the Mennen's" to the envelope.

** Letter Albany, Ind. M to H May 9, 1944

April 9, 1944 (ed. actually May 9, 1994)

Dearest -

This is the letter that I've been wanting to write. I wish I knew you would be there when I arrive but I know I will be closer to you and free to come to you within a short time.

I plan on leaving Albany on the 9:20 and getting to Lafayette about 12:30. Then I go by Big Four to Chicago. I'll have a couple hours in Lafayette. That will give me time to go to the bank and to eat. I also want to go to Mrs. Wallings and get her sisters address. Clara lives at Los Angeles or Long Beach.

I telegramed Mr. Pike for a Pullman reservation but he called Albany that he had fallen and couldn't go uptown. I'll get to Chicago what about 6:30 and will have until 10 to get a reservation. If I don't get it I'll come anyway. I also wired The Drake Hotel for a room for May 13th but I can't depend on it.

I've written airmail to Mrs. Henlay and Rienhart so I'll be able to learn the news as fast as possible when I arrive. Don't know why I'm telling you all this but one never knows what complications can come up. The girls have all been so good to me and their letters encourage me for they all think you were coming in and will have a longer stay than before.

I have stored the car in Ralph Shaw's garage so it will be well cared for.

Mom and grandmother are thrilled at the thoughts of having Barbara. I know she will be well cared for but I shall miss her. I didn't write last evening but I thought about us after I went to bed. It seems that I have all the pieces of happiness. I have a nice home with the modern conveniences. I have a wonderful husband who fulfills all my hopes of what married life would be like who I love and admire. I have his love and a pretty healthy daughter. I have all these things but like a puzzle they are scattered all over the world. I seem to be able to get a couple of the pieces together but I can't seem to get the complete picture. When the puzzle is worked I'll have a picture of complete happiness. Then I went to sleep.

I have not tried to imagine the happiness we will share when we are together. I am going to enjoy every minute of the trip. I know I shall beam all the way there. We will have the vacation of our lives. It will be like a honeymoon and have the advantage of our memories of years together and build memories for our weeks apart.

I really should return to business. Since I don't know you're there I will not telegram you as to which train I take. I'll go to the Grant Hotel as soon as possible and also call Jane Henley. I'll leave word for you at the Grant so you'll know where to find me and I'll ask for word from you

I loved the Mennens on the envelope but I would like it better on my pillow. Now I must close to finish packing. I'm all done but deciding what business papers and cameras to bring.

I'm impatient too.

Lovingly,

Mildred

** Penny Post Card Albany Ind. M to Folks May 9, 1944

May 9, 4 PM Albany, Indiana (Tuesday)

Dear Folks -

Arrived with no trouble. Barbara slept for about an hour.

I forgot the iron but do not worry for I'll get one here. They have several.

Unless I hear differently I'll go to Chicago Wed.

Do not work too hard.

I'll write as soon as I know more.

Love,

Mildred

** May 14, 1944 San Diego Cal. M to Folks 

Dear folks -

Arrived in Los Angeles 3 1/2 hours late. Only had to wait 1 1/2 hours until I could go on. It was 6:15 when we arrived in San Diego. The country is beautiful and people were good to point out things to me.

In San Diego I went directly to the Grant Hotel. Before I could get to the desk to ask for a letter for me, I saw Smitty. He had just got in. We really made perfect connections. We have the room in the Drake hotel. It is very clean and nicely furnished.

Smitty almost had to leave Sun morning but Captain Hunter convinced the officials that they needed repairs. The repairs are going to be done in San Pedro. So we will be here until Tues or Wednesday and then on the L.A. I would like to be here longer but of course there is so much to do in L.A. that I would not miss San Diego.

Smitty and I went out last night and saw so much that I don't know what I saw. He had to go on board today of course but will be home about five.

I haven't contacted any of the other girls but will call while I'm out to breakfast.

I don't know Smitty's plans as yet but we should have a nice stay in Los Angeles. Will let you know as soon as we get there and get an address.

The only way you could reach me until then would be through Va. aunt.

In care of R. R. Robertson 2291 Mareno Drive Los Angeles 26

Smitty is looking fine and we are very happy.

Love

Mildred

We often speak of our little girl. I know she is well cared for.

** Text

It wasn’t that Mildred wasn’t used to living on a farm. She’d lived on a string of them, from the Montana homestead where she’d been born through the string of run-down Indiana farms that the folks had cleaned-up, gotten running again, and then moved to the next one during the thirties. And it wasn’t that she’d gotten out of practice - using an outhouse, carrying water from a pump, heating bath water on a cook stove weren’t the sort of things that you have to practice day in and day out to be able to pick up again. Barbara was company, approaching a year old, teething and always active. Still, with the folks working in the fields until ten every night, and not knowing any of the neighbors, it was lonely.

She and Homer had discussed her moving to California to be close by whenever the KatyB returned to the States, but housing was tighter in California than even in Indianapolis and it was all but impossible to get without holding a war-related job. Indiana was a much more secure option, but as February became March and then April, California, even for a visit, seemed more and more attractive.

Expecially after the first “working voyage” in early March took the KatyB from San Diego to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides and back to San Diego in a little over a month, it began to look as if the idea of another trip to California to meet him after the next voyage might be workable. They had unloaded, reloaded and were away again in only three days, but that could have been three days together! Several of the other ship’s officers wives were living in or near San Diego and were anxious to help. It was just a matter of getting some idea when the KatyB would be back stateside.

There was a downside to Homer being a communications officer. The radio shack where he worked was far below decks, hard next to the steam catapult — always hot and and stuffy and insanely loud whenever launching aircraft. On the other hand, he knew what was happening even before the Skipper and the Exec did. When a departure date or ETA (estimated time of arrival) was set, he knew it first. He would have to be somewhat coy about writing this to Mildred — his letters had to get past the on-ship censors — but he had a pretty good idea what he could get away with. This paid off on April 28th when he learned that they would be departing Majuro Atoll the next day:

Now, Homer at Majuro Atoll in the South Pacific is 5,600 miles away from Mildred in Brookston, Indiana, and it’s going to take a while for his letter to reach her — in fact, it’s going to take eleven days:
