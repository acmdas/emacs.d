** 10:48 Contacted BCBS, they have no record of receiving a bill for Maria 1/11/2021 from Medicare. Medicare says that they have no information about my secondary Part B coverage, which sounds bogus, but the lady got huffy when I asked about what worked for the previous 9 years, so I left it at that and wrote Hopkins a letter and suggested that they arrange something. That’s in the mailbox now. I also copied the letter contents to an online message that Hopkins won’t read (they promise to read within 24 hours but my last message hasn’t been read in a week). So that’s a PITA but I’ve done my bit for now. Finished/caught up on scanning.
** 14:26 Walked with Valerie, worked some on the Annual Meeting Minutes, can’t bring myself to listen to the audio yet.
** 16:26 Soup is pretty well made. Needs to cook down the veggies and add rice and chicken. Texted Adam S. that I won’t be at Men’s Dinner this week. Valerie is talking to Ans, Sophia spent a nice visit and just left.
