** 10:48 Contacted BCBS, they have no record of receiving a bill for Maria 1/11/2021 from Medicare. Medicare says that they have no information about my secondary Part B coverage, which sounds bogus, but the lady got huffy when I asked about what worked for the previous 9 years, so I left it at that and wrote Hopkins a letter and suggested that they arrange something. That’s in the mailbox now. I also copied the letter contents to an online message that Hopkins won’t read (they promise to read within 24 hours but my last message hasn’t been read in a week). So that’s a PITA but I’ve done my bit for now. Finished/caught up on scanning.
** 14:26 Walked with Valerie, worked some on the Annual Meeting Minutes, can’t bring myself to listen to the audio yet.
** 16:26 Soup is pretty well made. Needs to cook down the veggies and add rice and chicken. Texted Adam S. that I won’t be at Men’s Dinner this week. Valerie is talking to Ans, Sophia spent a nice visit and just left.

** 10:09 What’s going to heppen with the Bells for Mothers’ Day is still up in the air. My impression is that Miriam is leaning toward going to a restaurant. My impression is that it’s likely to be almost as busy as on Valentine’s Day, but I’m not going to try to drive the bus, just find out where and when to get on. Cathy asked about the Annual Meeting Report, so it’s time to listen to the audio recording.
** 11:05 I think I’m ready to begin listening to the audio - went outside and chopped the umbrella cardboard cover up so that it fits in the recycling bin. Valerie is going to shower, then go to Costco for a med at the pharmacy and maybe go to Lowes to look for a lawn sprinkler.
** 14:13 More than half way through the audio, FWIW.

** 23:03 Got the report off to Cathy around 4 or so, had a nap. Watched “Hot Fuzz”.

** 07:22 TSA has issued me a precheck number. Now I just need my passport back and to renew my DL on June 7 and I’ll be ID’d for the next little while.
** 16:45 Just sent the draft Minutes to everyone. The Bells dropped by around 1400 to say “Hi” and drop off a flower for Valerie. The smoke alarm went off yet again this morning and Valerie has been rattled ever since. Likely going to dump the Kidde units and get something else. Maybe another from Frontpoint. Bells are coming back around 5 with sushi (tempura for Valerie). We’ve done a bit of tidying up. Haven’t mentioned it but it seems that Josie is dying and will check out any day now. Adriana is her caregiver and they seem to have patched up their relationship pretty well. 
** 21:58 Sushi dinner with the Bells - shrimp tempura for Valerie. Fine cake for dessert. A wonderful time was had by all.

** 14:13 Identified the rattle in the CR-V as coming from the muffler. Added a strap to the heat shield. Ran to Giant for milk, eggs and bananas. Nyger seed from Mother Nature. Refilled the bird sock. Moved the smaller brown book case to the guest bedroom.

** 11:47 Mowed and trimmed front yard. Trimmed edges. Dug-up volunteer irises. Watered back yard and black gum. Installed shelves in new cabinet and emptied books and knick-knacks. Just need to move CDs and DVDs to vinyl cases and it will be ready to move into the NE corner of the studio, the table that’s there will replace it. Then a quick slide of the TV on the piano bench over in front of the fireplace, move the love seat back under the window, and the LR will be as much as it’s planned to be as it can for now. A good morning’s work on the house, now to see whether I can do anything on the War Story, like outline their activities between the Grant Hotel meeting and the evening in Aunt Geet’s house when she got the lead for the ship yard.

** 09:48 Got a little work done on the War Story - back oriented with the end of June, early July 1944. Apparently the visit with Gete that led to the Shipyard job happened in that quiet time at the very end of June when there aren’t any surviving letters (or that I haven’t found) to pin it down. At any rate the first reference that I have is July 2, at which point she isn’t sure that she’ll take it, but it is $185/mo. By the 6th she has visited the shipyard and filled out forms, so she seems to have decided to stay in Long Beach and take the job.
** 13:11 Valerie is talking with Ans now. She watered the front garden and fed some of them, I moved the larger Billy bookcase into the studio (perfect fit in the NE corner!) and rearranged the LR - love seat back by the S window, TV in front of the fireplace, wicker where the smaller Billy was, leather chair next to it, glass-topped table where the bigger Billy was. Looks nice. Copied Calibre library to the Mac again, also updated the epub books from Calibre on the backup drive. Will probably copy all of them to the kindle card at some point. Taking a rest now.
** 16:40 Got the TV and etc. all working in the new location, with the cables tidied up a bit.

** 11:44 Walked to the Brett La RAC house - lighting could be an issue if the wattage is too high. Valerie has gone to Wegmans. We removed covers from the roses, I got some blood on my shorts and am doing a laundry.
** 14:39 Had a nice talk with Jesse, made our bed with the cotton blanket, Valerie is off having a haircut.

** 18:15 I wanted to acknowledge to Harold that yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Joplin tornados, and when I logged into the daslearns.ca email, found a number of messages from him that hadn’t made it into mu4e. Took a while, but learned how to do a debug run and that account had not been unlocked after a run around May 5th. Rebooted, and it seems to be working now.

She’s likely to need some hand holding the next 24 hours, but so far today she’s been better than a few days ago - maybe taking Xanex more regularly, maybe just come to terms with it.
