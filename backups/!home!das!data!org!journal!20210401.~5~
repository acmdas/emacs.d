** 07:16 2320-0634, 6:34 89. Raining, 40F. We go to TSAPreCheck clearance at Staples today at 1300.
** 15:08 Got my application in - discovered that I need to renew my passport, and nobody seems to take passport pictures these days. Valerie’s application bombed out because of her old green card. I’ve completed her application for replacement - the fee is over $500!
** 21:21 RAC went well. Going to be a chilly night - the new plants that Valerie bought the other day are all in the kitchen overnight.

** 07:10 0031-0620, 5:23 83. Clear, 29F. Eye exam at 1000, take photo to Walgreen’s to print as passport photo.
** 10:24 Back from the eye appointment. Drops have my vision somewhat fuzzy. Not a big change, but some. Worth the $40. Nigel is speaking at his home group at 1500.

** 07:05 2310-0624, 6:22 87. Clear, 30F. The prospect of becoming a citizen, or even just the issues around updating her green card, if weighing heavily on Valerie. Perhaps the best next step will be to get in touch with our Congressperson or Senator’s office and find out whether there’s any way to pull some strings and get TSAPre or Global Entry with her present card.
** 14:33 Bread is in the oven - just dropped the temperature, 30 minutes to go. Have added a few notes to the Foreign outline and also WarStory.
